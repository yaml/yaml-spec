<code>**Status of this Document**</code>

This is the **YAML specification v1.2.2**.
It defines the **YAML 1.2 data language**.
There are no normative changes from the **YAML specification v1.2**.
The primary objectives of this version are to correct errors and add clarity.

This version also strives to make the YAML language development process more
open, more transparent and easier for people to contribute to.
The input format is now Markdown instead of DocBook, and the images are made
from plain text LaTeX files rather than proprietary drawing software.
All the source content for the specification is publicly hosted[^spec-repo].

The previous YAML specification[^1-2-spec] was published about 12 years ago.
In that time span, YAML's popularity has grown significantly.
Efforts are ongoing to improve the language and grow it to meet the needs and
expectations of its users.
While this version of the specification makes no actual changes to YAML, it
begins a process by which the language intends to evolve and stay modern.

The YAML specification is often seen as overly complicated for something which
appears to be so simple.
Even though YAML often is used for software configuration, it has always been
and will continue to be a complete data serialization language.
Future YAML plans are focused on making the language and ecosystem more
powerful and reliable while simultaneously simplifying the development process
for implementers.

While this version of the specification is limiting itself to informational
changes only, there is companion documentation intended to guide YAML framework
implementers and YAML language users.
This documentation can continue to evolve and expand continually between
published versions of this specification.

<code>**Abstract**</code>

YAML™ (rhymes with "camel") is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based
data serialization language designed around the common native data types of
dynamic programming languages.
It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to
internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing and visualization.
Together with the Unicode standard for characters[^unicode], this specification
provides all the information necessary to understand YAML Version 1.2 and to
create programs that process YAML information.

<code># Chapter #. Introduction</code>

YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a data
serialization language designed to be human-friendly and work well with modern
programming languages for common everyday tasks.
This specification is both an introduction to the YAML language and the
concepts supporting it.
It is also a complete specification of the information needed to develop
[applications] for processing YAML.

Open, interoperable and readily understandable tools have advanced computing
immensely.
YAML was designed from the start to be useful and friendly to people working
with data.
It uses Unicode [printable] characters, [some] of which provide structural
information and the rest containing the data itself.
YAML achieves a unique cleanness by minimizing the amount of structural
characters and allowing the data to show itself in a natural and meaningful
way.
For example, [indentation] may be used for structure, [colons] separate
[key/value pairs] and [dashes] are used to create "bulleted" [lists].

There are many kinds of [data structures], but they can all be adequately
[represented] with three basic primitives: [mappings] (hashes/dictionaries),
[sequences] (arrays/lists) and [scalars] (strings/numbers).
YAML leverages these primitives and adds a simple typing system and [aliasing]
mechanism to form a complete language for [serializing] any [native data
structure].
While most programming languages can use YAML for data serialization, YAML
excels in working with those languages that are fundamentally built around the
three basic primitives.
These include common dynamic languages such as JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python
and Ruby.

There are hundreds of different languages for programming, but only a handful
of languages for storing and transferring data.
Even though its potential is virtually boundless, YAML was specifically created
to work well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files,
interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence and
debugging of complex data structures.
When data is easy to view and understand, programming becomes a simpler task.


<code>## #. Goals</code>

The design goals for YAML are, in decreasing priority:

1. YAML should be easily readable by humans.
1. YAML data should be portable between programming languages.
1. YAML should match the [native data structures] of dynamic languages.
1. YAML should have a consistent model to support generic tools.
1. YAML should support one-pass processing.
1. YAML should be expressive and extensible.
1. YAML should be easy to implement and use.


<code>## #. YAML History</code>

The YAML 1.0 specification was published in early 2004 by by Clark Evans, Oren
Ben-Kiki, and Ingy döt Net after 3 years of collaborative design work through
the yaml-core mailing list[^yaml-core].
The project was initially rooted in Clark and Oren's work on the
SML-DEV[^sml-dev] mailing list (for simplifying XML) and Ingy's plain text
serialization module[^denter] for Perl.
The language took a lot of inspiration from many other technologies and formats
that preceded it.

The first YAML framework was written in Perl in 2001 and Ruby was the first
language to ship a YAML framework as part of its core language distribution in
2003.

The YAML 1.1[^1-1-spec] specification was published in 2005.
Around this time, the developers became aware of JSON[^json].
By sheer coincidence, JSON was almost a complete subset of YAML (both
syntactically and semantically).

In 2006, Kirill Simonov produced PyYAML[^pyyaml] and LibYAML[^libyaml].
A lot of the YAML frameworks in various programming languages are built over
LibYAML and many others have looked to PyYAML as a solid reference for their
implementations.

The YAML 1.2[^1-2-spec] specification was published in 2009.
Its primary focus was making YAML a strict superset of JSON.
It also removed many of the problematic implicit typing recommendations.

Since the release of the 1.2 specification, YAML adoption has continued to
grow, and many large-scale projects use it as their primary configuration
format.
In 2020, the new [YAML language design team](core-team) began meeting regularly
to discuss improvements to the YAML language and specification; to better meet
the needs and expectations of its users and use cases.

This YAML 1.2.2 specification, published in September 2021, is the first step
in YAML's rejuvenated development journey.
YAML is now more popular than it has ever been, but there is a long list of
things that need to be addressed for it to reach its full potential.
The YAML design team is focused on making YAML as good as possible.


<code>## #. Terminology</code>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119[^rfc-2119].


The rest of this document is arranged as follows.
Chapter [2] provides a short preview of the main YAML features.
Chapter [3] describes the YAML information model and the processes for
converting from and to this model and the YAML text format.
The bulk of the document, chapters [4] through [9], formally define this text
format.
Finally, chapter [10] recommends basic YAML schemas.


<code># Chapter #. Preview</code>

This section provides a quick glimpse into the expressive power of YAML.
It is not expected that the first-time reader grok all of the examples.
Rather, these selections are used as motivation for the remainder of the
specification.


<code>## #. Collections</code>

YAML's [block collections] use [indentation] for scope and begin each entry on
its own line.
[Block sequences] indicate each entry with a dash and space (["**`-`** "]).
[Mappings] use a colon and space (["**`:`** "]) to mark each [key/value pair].
[Comments] begin with an octothorpe (also called a "hash", "sharp", "pound" or
"number sign" - ["**`#`**"]).


<code>**Example #. Sequence of Scalars (ball players)**</code>

```
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey
```


<code>**Example #. Mapping Scalars to Scalars (player statistics)**</code>

```
hr:  65    # Home runs
avg: 0.278 # Batting average
rbi: 147   # Runs Batted In
```


<code>**Example #. Mapping Scalars to Sequences (ball clubs in each league)**</code>

```
american:
- Boston Red Sox
- Detroit Tigers
- New York Yankees
national:
- New York Mets
- Chicago Cubs
- Atlanta Braves
```


<code>**Example #. Sequence of Mappings (players' statistics)**</code>

```
-
  name: Mark McGwire
  hr:   65
  avg:  0.278
-
  name: Sammy Sosa
  hr:   63
  avg:  0.288
```

YAML also has [flow styles], using explicit [indicators] rather than
[indentation] to denote scope.
The [flow sequence] is written as a [comma] separated list within [square]
[brackets].
In a similar manner, the [flow mapping] uses [curly] [braces].


<code>**Example #. Sequence of Sequences**</code>

```
- [name        , hr, avg  ]
- [Mark McGwire, 65, 0.278]
- [Sammy Sosa  , 63, 0.288]
```


<code>**Example #. Mapping of Mappings**</code>

```
Mark McGwire: {hr: 65, avg: 0.278}
Sammy Sosa: {
    hr: 63,
    avg: 0.288,
 }
```


<code>## #. Structures</code>

YAML uses three dashes (["**`---`**"]) to separate [directives] from [document]
[content].
This also serves to signal the start of a document if no [directives] are
present.
Three dots ( ["**`...`**"]) indicate the end of a document without starting a
new one, for use in communication channels.


<code>**Example #. Two Documents in a Stream (each with a leading comment)**</code>

```
<code># Ranking of 1998 home runs</code>
---
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey

<code># Team ranking</code>
---
- Chicago Cubs
- St Louis Cardinals
```


<code>**Example #. Play by Play Feed from a Game**</code>

```
---
time: 20:03:20
player: Sammy Sosa
action: strike (miss)
...
---
time: 20:03:47
player: Sammy Sosa
action: grand slam
...
```

Repeated [nodes] (objects) are first [identified] by an [anchor] (marked with
the ampersand - ["**`&amp;`**"]) and are then [aliased] (referenced with an
asterisk - ["**`*`**"]) thereafter.


<code>**Example #. Single Document with Two Comments**</code>

```
---
hr: # 1998 hr ranking
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
<code># 1998 rbi ranking</code>
rbi:
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey
```


<code>**Example #. Node for "**`Sammy Sosa`**" appears twice in this document**</code>

```
---
hr:
- Mark McGwire
<code># Following node labeled SS</code>
- &amp;SS Sammy Sosa
rbi:
- *SS # Subsequent occurrence
- Ken Griffey
```

A question mark and space (["**`?`** "]) indicate a complex [mapping] [key].
Within a [block collection], [key/value pairs] can start immediately following
the [dash], [colon] or [question mark].


<code>**Example #. Mapping between Sequences**</code>

```
? - Detroit Tigers
  - Chicago cubs
: - 2001-07-23

? [ New York Yankees,
    Atlanta Braves ]
: [ 2001-07-02, 2001-08-12,
    2001-08-14 ]
```


<code>**Example #. Compact Nested Mapping**</code>

```
---
<code># Products purchased</code>
- item    : Super Hoop
  quantity: 1
- item    : Basketball
  quantity: 4
- item    : Big Shoes
  quantity: 1
```


<code>## #. Scalars</code>

[Scalar content] can be written in [block] notation, using a [literal style]
(indicated by ["**`|`**"]) where all [line breaks] are significant.
Alternatively, they can be written with the [folded style] [(denoted by
"**`&gt;`**"]) where each [line break] is [folded] to a [space] unless it ends an
[empty] or a [more-indented] line.


<code>**Example #. In literals, newlines are preserved**</code>

```
<code># ASCII Art</code>
--- |
  \//||\/||
  // ||  ||__
```


<code>**Example #. In the folded scalars, newlines become spaces**</code>

```
--- &gt;
  Mark McGwire's
  year was crippled
  by a knee injury.
```


<code>**Example #. Folded newlines are preserved for "more indented" and blank
lines**</code>

```
--- &gt;
 Sammy Sosa completed another
 fine season with great stats.

   63 Home Runs
   0.288 Batting Average

 What a year!
```


<code>**Example #. Indentation determines scope**</code>

```
name: Mark McGwire
accomplishment: &gt;
  Mark set a major league
  home run record in 1998.
stats: |
  65 Home Runs
  0.278 Batting Average
```

YAML's [flow scalars] include the [plain style] (most examples thus far) and
two quoted styles.
The [double-quoted style] provides [escape sequences].
The [single-quoted style] is useful when [escaping] is not needed.
All [flow scalars] can span multiple lines; [line breaks] are always [folded].


<code>**Example #. Quoted Scalars**</code>

```
unicode: "Sosa did fine.\u263A"
control: "\b1998\t1999\t2000\n"
hex esc: "\x0d\x0a is \r\n"

single: '"Howdy!" he cried.'
quoted: ' # Not a ''comment''.'
tie-fighter: '|\-*-/|'
```


<code>**Example #. Multi-line Flow Scalars**</code>

```
plain:
  This unquoted scalar
  spans many lines.

quoted: "So does this
  quoted scalar.\n"
```


<code>## #. Tags</code>

In YAML, [untagged nodes] are given a type depending on the [application].
The examples in this specification generally use the [**`seq`**], [**`map`**]
and [**`str`**] types from the [fail safe schema].
A few examples also use the [**`int`**], [**`float`**] and [**`null`**] types
from the [JSON schema].


<code>**Example #. Integers**</code>

```
canonical: 12345
decimal: +12345
octal: 0o14
hexadecimal: 0xC
```


<code>**Example #. Floating Point**</code>

```
canonical: 1.23015e+3
exponential: 12.3015e+02
fixed: 1230.15
negative infinity: -.inf
not a number: .nan
```


<code>**Example #. Miscellaneous**</code>

```
null:
booleans: [ true, false ]
string: '012345'
```


<code>**Example #. Timestamps**</code>

```
canonical: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z
iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
spaced: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5
date: 2002-12-14
```

Explicit typing is denoted with a [tag] using the exclamation point
(["**`!`**"]) symbol.
[Global tags] are URIs and may be specified in a [tag shorthand] notation using
a [handle].
[Application]\-specific [local tags] may also be used.


<code>**Example #. Various Explicit Tags**</code>

<code># Chapter #. Processing YAML Information</code>

YAML is both a text format and a method for [presenting] any [native data
structure] in this format.
Therefore, this specification defines two concepts: a class of data objects
called YAML [representations] and a syntax for [presenting] YAML
[representations] as a series of characters, called a YAML [stream].
A YAML _processor_ is a tool for converting information between these
complementary views.
It is assumed that a YAML processor does its work on behalf of another module,
called an _application_.
This chapter describes the information structures a YAML processor must provide
to or obtain from the application.

YAML information is used in two ways: for machine processing and for human
consumption.
The challenge of reconciling these two perspectives is best done in three
distinct translation stages: [representation], [serialization] and
[presentation].
[Representation] addresses how YAML views [native data structures] to achieve
portability between programming environments.
[Serialization] concerns itself with turning a YAML [representation] into a
serial form, that is, a form with sequential access constraints.
[Presentation] deals with the formatting of a YAML [serialization] as a series
of characters in a human-friendly manner.


<code>## #. Processes</code>

Translating between [native data structures] and a character [stream] is done
in several logically distinct stages, each with a well defined input and output
data model, as shown in the following diagram:


<code>**Figure #. Processing Overview**</code>

![Processing Overview](img/overview2.svg)

A YAML processor need not expose the [serialization] or [representation]
stages.
It may translate directly between [native data structures] and a character
[stream] ([dump] and [load] in the diagram above).
However, such a direct translation should take place so that the [native data
structures] are [constructed] only from information available in the
[representation].
In particular, [mapping key order], [comments] and [tag handles] should not be
referenced during [construction].


<code>### #. Dump</code>

_Dumping_ native data structures to a character [stream] is done using the
following three stages:


? Representing Native Data Structures

: YAML _represents_ any _native data structure_ using three [node kinds]:
[sequence] - an ordered series of entries; [mapping] - an unordered association
of [unique] [keys] to [values]; and [scalar] - any datum with opaque structure
presentable as a series of Unicode characters.

: Combined, these primitives generate directed graph structures.
These primitives were chosen because they are both powerful and familiar: the
[sequence] corresponds to a Perl array and a Python list, the [mapping]
corresponds to a Perl hash table and a Python dictionary.
The [scalar] represents strings, integers, dates and other atomic data types.

: Each YAML [node] requires, in addition to its [kind] and [content], a [tag]
specifying its data type.
Type specifiers are either [global] URIs or are [local] in scope to a single
[application].
For example, an integer is represented in YAML with a [scalar] plus the [global
tag] "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:int`**".
Similarly, an invoice object, particular to a given organization, could be
represented as a [mapping] together with the [local tag] "**`!invoice`**".
This simple model can represent any data structure independent of programming
language.


? Serializing the Representation Graph

: For sequential access mediums, such as an event callback API, a YAML
[representation] must be _serialized_ to an ordered tree.
Since in a YAML [representation], [mapping keys] are unordered and [nodes] may
be referenced more than once (have more than one incoming "arrow"), the
serialization process is required to impose an [ordering] on the [mapping keys]
and to replace the second and subsequent references to a given [node] with
place holders called [aliases].
YAML does not specify how these _serialization details_ are chosen.
It is up to the YAML [processor] to come up with human-friendly [key order] and
[anchor] names, possibly with the help of the [application].
The result of this process, a YAML [serialization tree], can then be traversed
to produce a series of event calls for one-pass processing of YAML data.


? Presenting the Serialization Tree

: The final output process is _presenting_ the YAML [serializations] as a
character [stream] in a human-friendly manner.
To maximize human readability, YAML offers a rich set of stylistic options
which go far beyond the minimal functional needs of simple data storage.
Therefore the YAML [processor] is required to introduce various _presentation
details_ when creating the [stream], such as the choice of [node styles], how
to [format scalar content], the amount of [indentation], which [tag handles] to
use, the [node tags] to leave [unspecified], the set of [directives] to provide
and possibly even what [comments] to add.
While some of this can be done with the help of the [application], in general
this process should be guided by the preferences of the user.


<code>### #. Load</code>

_Loading_ [native data structures] from a character [stream] is done using the
following three stages:


? Parsing the Presentation Stream

: _Parsing_ is the inverse process of [presentation], it takes a [stream] of
characters and produces a [serialization tree].
Parsing discards all the [details] introduced in the [presentation] process,
reporting only the [serialization tree].
Parsing can fail due to [ill-formed] input.


? Composing the Representation Graph

: _Composing_ takes a [serialization tree] and produces a [representation
graph].
Composing discards all the [details] introduced in the [serialization] process,
producing only the [representation graph].
Composing can fail due to any of several reasons, detailed [below].


? Constructing Native Data Structures

: The final input process is _constructing_ [native data structures] from the
YAML [representation].
Construction must be based only on the information available in the
[representation] and not on additional [serialization] or [presentation
details] such as [comments], [directives], [mapping key order], [node styles],
[scalar content format], [indentation] levels etc.
Construction can fail due to the [unavailability] of the required [native data
types].


<code>## #. Information Models</code>

This section specifies the formal details of the results of the above
processes.
To maximize data portability between programming languages and implementations,
users of YAML should be mindful of the distinction between [serialization] or
[presentation] properties and those which are part of the YAML
[representation].
Thus, while imposing a [order] on [mapping keys] is necessary for flattening
YAML [representations] to a sequential access medium, this [serialization
detail] must not be used to convey [application] level information.
In a similar manner, while [indentation] technique and a choice of a [node
style] are needed for the human readability, these [presentation details] are
neither part of the YAML [serialization] nor the YAML [representation].
By carefully separating properties needed for [serialization] and
[presentation], YAML [representations] of [application] information will be
consistent and portable between various programming environments.

The following diagram summarizes the three _information models_.
Full arrows denote composition, hollow arrows denote inheritance, "**`1`**" and
"**`*`**" denote "one" and "many" relationships.
A single "**`+`**" denotes [serialization] details, a double "**`++`**" denotes
[presentation] details.


<code>**Figure #. Information Models**</code>

![Information Models](img/model2.svg)


<code>### #. Representation Graph</code>

YAML's _representation_ of [native data structure] is a rooted, connected,
directed graph of [tagged] [nodes].
By "directed graph" we mean a set of [nodes] and directed edges ("arrows"),
where each edge connects one [node] to another (see a formal directed graph
definition[^digraph]).
All the [nodes] must be reachable from the _root node_ via such edges.
Note that the YAML graph may include cycles and a [node] may have more than one
incoming edge.

[Nodes] that are defined in terms of other [nodes] are [collections]; [nodes]
that are independent of any other [nodes] are [scalars].
YAML supports two [kinds] of [collection nodes]: [sequences] and [mappings].
[Mapping nodes] are somewhat tricky because their [keys] are unordered and must
be [unique].


<code>**Figure #. Representation Model**</code>

![Representation Model](img/represent2.svg)


<code>#### #. Nodes</code>

A YAML _node_ [represents] a single [native data structure].
Such nodes have _content_ of one of three _kinds_: scalar, sequence or mapping.
In addition, each node has a [tag] which serves to restrict the set of possible
values the content can have.


? Scalar

: The content of a _scalar_ node is an opaque datum that can be [presented] as
a series of zero or more Unicode characters.


? Sequence

: The content of a _sequence_ node is an ordered series of zero or more nodes.
In particular, a sequence may contain the same node more than once.
It could even contain itself.


? Mapping

: The content of a _mapping_ node is an unordered set of _key/value_ node
_pairs_, with the restriction that each of the keys is [unique].
YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes.
In particular, keys may be arbitrary nodes, the same node may be used as the
value of several key/value pairs and a mapping could even contain itself as a
key or a value.


<code>#### #. Tags</code>

YAML [represents] type information of [native data structures] with a simple
identifier, called a _tag_.
_Global tags_ are URIs and hence globally unique across all [applications].
The "**`tag:`**" URI scheme[^tag-uri] is recommended for all global YAML tags.
In contrast, _local tags_ are specific to a single [application].
Local tags start with _"**`!`**"_, are not URIs and are not expected to be
globally unique.
YAML provides a ["**`TAG`**" directive] to make tag notation less verbose; it
also offers easy migration from local to global tags.
To ensure this, local tags are restricted to the URI character set and use URI
character [escaping].

YAML does not mandate any special relationship between different tags that
begin with the same substring.
Tags ending with URI fragments (containing "**`#`**") are no exception; tags
that share the same base URI but differ in their fragment part are considered
to be different, independent tags.
By convention, fragments are used to identify different "variants" of a tag,
while "**`/`**" is used to define nested tag "namespace" hierarchies.
However, this is merely a convention and each tag may employ its own rules.
For example, Perl tags may use "**`::`**" to express namespace hierarchies,
Java tags may use "**`.`**", etc.

YAML tags are used to associate meta information with each [node].
In particular, each tag must specify the expected [node kind] ([scalar],
[sequence] or [mapping]).
[Scalar] tags must also provide a mechanism for converting [formatted content]
to a [canonical form] for supporting [equality] testing.
Furthermore, a tag may provide additional information such as the set of
allowed [content] values for validation, a mechanism for [tag resolution] or
any other data that is applicable to all of the tag's [nodes].


<code>#### #. Node Comparison</code>

Since YAML [mappings] require [key] uniqueness, [representations] must include
a mechanism for testing the equality of [nodes].
This is non-trivial since YAML allows various ways to [format scalar content].
For example, the integer eleven can be written as "**`0o13`**" (octal) or
"**`0xB`**" (hexadecimal).
If both notations are used as [keys] in the same [mapping], only a YAML
[processor] which recognizes integer [formats] would correctly flag the
duplicate [key] as an error.


? Canonical Form

: YAML supports the need for [scalar] equality by requiring that every [scalar]
[tag] must specify a mechanism for producing the _canonical form_ of any
[formatted content].
This form is a Unicode character string which also [presents] the same
[content] and can be used for equality testing.


? Equality

: Two [nodes] must have the same [tag] and [content] to be _equal_.
Since each [tag] applies to exactly one [kind], this implies that the two
[nodes] must have the same [kind] to be equal.
Two [scalars] are equal only when their [tags] and canonical forms are equal
character-by-character.
Equality of [collections] is defined recursively.
Two [sequences] are equal only when they have the same [tag] and length and
each [node] in one [sequence] is equal to the corresponding [node] in the other
[sequence].
Two [mappings] are equal only when they have the same [tag] and an equal set of
[keys] and each [key] in this set is associated with equal [values] in both
[mappings].

: Different URI schemes may define different rules for testing the equality of
URIs.
Since a YAML [processor] cannot be reasonably expected to be aware of them all,
it must resort to a simple character-by-character comparison of [tags] to
ensure consistency.
This also happens to be the comparison method defined by the "**`tag:`**" URI
scheme.
[Tags] in a YAML stream must therefore be [presented] in a canonical way so
that such comparison would yield the correct results.

&gt; If a node has itself as a descendant (via an alias), then determining the
equality of that node is implementation-defined.

: A YAML [processor] may treat equal [scalars] as if they were identical.


? Uniqueness

: A [mapping's] [keys] are _unique_ if no two keys are equal to each other.
Obviously, identical nodes are always considered equal.


<code>### #. Serialization Tree</code>

To express a YAML [representation] using a serial API, it is necessary to
impose an [order] on [mapping keys] and employ [alias nodes] to indicate a
subsequent occurrence of a previously encountered [node].
The result of this process is a _serialization tree_, where each [node] has an
ordered set of children.
This tree can be traversed for a serial event-based API.
[Construction] of [native data structures] from the serial interface should not
use [key order] or [anchor names] for the preservation of [application] data.


<code>**Figure #. Serialization Model**</code>

![Serialization Model](img/serialize2.svg)


<code>#### #. Mapping Key Order</code>

In the [representation] model, [mapping keys] do not have an order.
To [serialize] a [mapping], it is necessary to impose an _ordering_ on its
[keys].
This order is a [serialization detail] and should not be used when [composing]
the [representation graph] (and hence for the preservation of [application]
data).
In every case where [node] order is significant, a [sequence] must be used.
For example, an ordered [mapping] can be [represented] as a [sequence] of
[mappings], where each [mapping] is a single [key/value pair].
YAML provides convenient [compact notation] for this case.


<code>#### #. Anchors and Aliases</code>

In the [representation graph], a [node] may appear in more than one
[collection].
When [serializing] such data, the first occurrence of the [node] is
_identified_ by an _anchor_.
Each subsequent occurrence is [serialized] as an [alias node] which refers back
to this anchor.
Otherwise, anchor names are a [serialization detail] and are discarded once
[composing] is completed.
When [composing] a [representation graph] from [serialized] events, an alias
event refers to the most recent event in the [serialization] having the
specified anchor.
Therefore, anchors need not be unique within a [serialization].
In addition, an anchor need not have an alias node referring to it.


<code>### #. Presentation Stream</code>

A YAML _presentation_ is a [stream] of Unicode characters making use of
[styles], [scalar content formats], [comments], [directives] and other
[presentation details] to [present] a YAML [serialization] in a human readable
way.
YAML allows several [serialization trees] to be contained in the same YAML
presentation stream, as a series of [documents] separated by [markers].


<code>**Figure #. Presentation Model**</code>

![Presentation Model](img/present2.svg)


<code>#### #. Node Styles</code>

Each [node] is presented in some _style_, depending on its [kind].
The node style is a [presentation detail] and is not reflected in the
[serialization tree] or [representation graph].
There are two groups of styles.
[Block styles] use [indentation] to denote structure.
In contrast, [flow styles] rely on explicit [indicators].

YAML provides a rich set of _scalar styles_.
[Block scalar] styles include the [literal style] and the [folded style].
[Flow scalar] styles include the [plain style] and two quoted styles, the
[single-quoted style] and the [double-quoted style].
These styles offer a range of trade-offs between expressive power and
readability.

Normally, [block sequences] and [mappings] begin on the next line.
In some cases, YAML also allows nested [block] [collections] to start in-line
for a more [compact notation].
In addition, YAML provides a [compact notation] for [flow mappings] with a
single [key/value pair], nested inside a [flow sequence].
These allow for a natural "ordered mapping" notation.


<code>**Figure #. Kind/Style Combinations**</code>

![Kind/Style Combinations](img/styles2.svg)


<code>#### #. Scalar Formats</code>

YAML allows [scalars] to be [presented] in several _formats_.
For example, the integer "**`11`**" might also be written as "**`0xB`**".
[Tags] must specify a mechanism for converting the formatted content to a
[canonical form] for use in [equality] testing.
Like [node style], the format is a [presentation detail] and is not reflected
in the [serialization tree] and [representation graph].


<code>#### #. Comments</code>

[Comments] are a [presentation detail] and must not have any effect on the
[serialization tree] or [representation graph].
In particular, comments are not associated with a particular [node].
The usual purpose of a comment is to communicate between the human maintainers
of a file.
A typical example is comments in a configuration file.
Comments must not appear inside [scalars], but may be interleaved with such
[scalars] inside [collections].


<code>#### #. Directives</code>

Each [document] may be associated with a set of [directives].
A directive has a name and an optional sequence of parameters.
Directives are instructions to the YAML [processor] and like all other
[presentation details] are not reflected in the YAML [serialization tree] or
[representation graph].
This version of YAML defines two directives, ["**`YAML`**"] and ["**`TAG`**"].
All other directives are [reserved] for future versions of YAML.


<code>## #. Loading Failure Points</code>

The process of [loading] [native data structures] from a YAML [stream] has
several potential _failure points_.
The character [stream] may be [ill-formed], [aliases] may be [unidentified],
[unspecified tags] may be [unresolvable], [tags] may be [unrecognized], the
[content] may be [invalid], [mapping] [keys] may not be [unique] and a native
type may be [unavailable].
Each of these failures results with an incomplete loading.

A _partial representation_ need not [resolve] the [tag] of each [node] and the
[canonical form] of [formatted scalar content] need not be available.
This weaker representation is useful for cases of incomplete knowledge of the
types used in the [document].

In contrast, a _complete representation_ specifies the [tag] of each [node] and
provides the [canonical form] of [formatted scalar content], allowing for
[equality] testing.
A complete representation is required in order to [construct] [native data
structures].


<code>**Figure #. Loading Failure Points**</code>

![Loading Failure Points](img/validity2.svg)


<code>### #. Well-Formed Streams and Identified Aliases</code>

A [well-formed] character [stream] must match the BNF productions specified in
the following chapters.
Successful loading also requires that each [alias] shall refer to a previous
[node] [identified] by the [anchor].
A YAML [processor] should reject _ill-formed streams_ and _unidentified
aliases_.
A YAML [processor] may recover from syntax errors, possibly by ignoring certain
parts of the input, but it must provide a mechanism for reporting such errors.


<code>### #. Resolved Tags</code>

Typically, most [tags] are not explicitly specified in the character [stream].
During [parsing], [nodes] lacking an explicit [tag] are given a _non-specific
tag_: _"**`!`**"_ for non-[plain scalars] and _"**`?`**"_ for all other
[nodes].
[Composing] a [complete representation] requires each such non-specific tag to
be _resolved_ to a _specific tag_, be it a [global tag] or a [local tag].

Resolving the [tag] of a [node] must only depend on the following three
parameters: (1) the non-specific tag of the [node], (2) the path leading from
the [root] to the [node] and (3) the [content] (and hence the [kind]) of the
[node].
When a [node] has more than one occurrence (using [aliases]), tag resolution
must depend only on the path to the first ([anchored]) occurrence of the
[node].

Note that resolution must not consider [presentation details] such as
[comments], [indentation] and [node style].
Also, resolution must not consider the [content] of any other [node], except
for the [content] of the [key nodes] directly along the path leading from the
[root] to the resolved [node].
Finally, resolution must not consider the [content] of a sibling [node] in a
[collection] or the [content] of the [value node] associated with a [key node]
being resolved.

These rules ensure that tag resolution can be performed as soon as a [node] is
first encountered in the [stream], typically before its [content] is [parsed].
Also, tag resolution only requires referring to a relatively small number of
previously parsed [nodes].
Thus, in most cases, tag resolution in one-pass [processors] is both possible
and practical.

YAML [processors] should resolve [nodes] having the "**`!`**" non-specific tag
as "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**", "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" or
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**" depending on their [kind].
This _tag resolution convention_ allows the author of a YAML character [stream]
to effectively "disable" the tag resolution process.
By explicitly specifying a "**`!`**" non-specific [tag property], the [node]
would then be resolved to a "vanilla" [sequence], [mapping] or string,
according to its [kind].

[Application] specific tag resolution rules should be restricted to resolving
the "**`?`**" non-specific tag, most commonly to resolving [plain scalars].
These may be matched against a set of regular expressions to provide automatic
resolution of integers, floats, timestamps and similar types.
An [application] may also match the [content] of [mapping nodes] against sets
of expected [keys] to automatically resolve points, complex numbers and similar
types.
Resolved [sequence node] types such as the "ordered mapping" are also possible.

That said, tag resolution is specific to the [application].
YAML [processors] should therefore provide a mechanism allowing the
[application] to override and expand these default tag resolution rules.

If a [document] contains _unresolved tags_, the YAML [processor] is unable to
[compose] a [complete representation] graph.
In such a case, the YAML [processor] may [compose] a [partial representation],
based on each [node's kind] and allowing for non-specific tags.


<code>### #. Recognized and Valid Tags</code>

To be _valid_, a [node] must have a [tag] which is _recognized_ by the YAML
[processor] and its [content] must satisfy the constraints imposed by this
[tag].
If a [document] contains a [scalar node] with an _unrecognized tag_ or _invalid
content_, only a [partial representation] may be [composed].
In contrast, a YAML [processor] can always [compose] a [complete
representation] for an unrecognized or an invalid [collection], since
[collection] [equality] does not depend upon knowledge of the [collection's]
data type.
However, such a [complete representation] cannot be used to [construct] a
[native data structure].


<code>### #. Available Tags</code>

In a given processing environment, there need not be an _available_ native type
corresponding to a given [tag].
If a [node's tag] is _unavailable_, a YAML [processor] will not be able to
[construct] a [native data structure] for it.
In this case, a [complete representation] may still be [composed] and an
[application] may wish to use this [representation] directly.


<code># Chapter #. Syntax Conventions</code>

The following chapters formally define the syntax of YAML character [streams],
using parameterized BNF productions.
Each BNF production is both named and numbered for easy reference.
Whenever possible, basic structures are specified before the more complex
structures using them in a "bottom up" fashion.

The productions are accompanied by examples which are presented in a two-pane
side-by-side format.
The left-hand side is the YAML example and the right-hand side is an alternate
YAML view of the example.
The right-hand view uses JSON when possible.
Otherwise it uses a YAML form that is as close to JSON as possible.


<code>## #. Production Syntax</code>

Productions are defined using the syntax `production-name ::= term`, where a
term is either:

* An atomic term:
  * A quoted string (`"abc"`), which matches that sequence of characters.
  * A hexadeximal number (`x0A`), which matches the character at that Unicode
    code point.
  * A range of hexadeximal numbers (`[x20-x7E]`), which matches any character
    whose Unicode code point is within that range.
  * The name of a production (`c-printable`), which matches that production.
* A lookaround:
  * `[lookahead = term]`, which matches the empty string if `term` would match.
  * `[lookahead ≠ term]`, which matches the empty string if `term` would not
    match.
  * `[lookbehind = term]`, which matches the empty string if `term` would match
  beginning at any prior point on the line and ending at the current position.
* A special production:
  * `&lt;empty&gt;`, which matches the empty string.
  * `&lt;impossible&gt;`, which cannot match.
  * `&lt;start of line&gt;`, which matches the empty string at the beginning of a
    line.
  * `&lt;end of input&gt;`, matches the empty string at the end of the input.
* A parenthesized term, which matches its contents.
* A sequence or alternation:
  * `term-one term-two`, which matches `term-one` followed by `term-two`.
  * `term-one | term-two`, which matches the `term-one` if possible, or
    `term-two` otherwise.
* A quantified term:
  * `term?`, which matches `(term | &lt;empty&gt;)`.
  * `term*`, which matches `(term term* | &lt;empty&gt;)`.
  * `term+`, which matches `(term term*)`.

The order of operations is parenthesization, then quantification, then
sequence, then alternation. For example, `a b | c d` is equivalent to
`(a b) | (c d)`.

Whitespace in productions is not significant except inside quoted strings.

<code>## #. Production Parameters</code>

Some productions have parameters in parentheses after the name, such as
[`s-line-prefix(n,c)`](#production-s-line-prefix).
A parameterized production is shorthand for a (infinite) series of productions,
each with a fixed value for each parameter.

For instance, this production:

```
production-a(n) ::= production-b(n)
```

Is shorthand for:

```
production-a(0) ::= production-b(0)
production-a(1) ::= production-b(1)
⋮
```

And this production:

```
production-a(n) ::=
  ( production-b(n+m) production-c(n+m) )+
```

Is shorthand for:

```
production-a(0) ::=
    ( production-b(0) production-c(0))+
  | ( production-b(1) production-c(1))+
  | …
production-a(1) ::=
    ( production-b(1) production-c(1))+
  | ( production-b(2) production-c(2))+
  | …
⋮
```

The parameters are as follows:

? Indentation: `n` or `m`

: May be any natural number, including zero. `n` may also be -1.


? Context: `c`

: This parameter allows productions to tweak their behavior according to their
surrounding.
YAML supports two groups of _contexts_, distinguishing between [block styles]
and [flow styles].

: May be any of the following values:

* `BLOCK-IN` -- inside block context
* `BLOCK-OUT` -- outside block context
* `BLOCK-KEY` -- inside block key context
* `FLOW-IN` -- inside flow context
* `FLOW-OUT` -- outside flow context
* `FLOW-KEY` -- inside flow key context


? (Block) Chomping: `t`

: The [line break] chomping behavior for flow scalars.
May be any of the following values:

* `STRIP` -- remove all trailing newlines
* `CLIP` -- remove all trailing newlines except the first
* `KEEP` -- retain all trailing newlines


<code>## #. Production Naming Conventions</code>

To make it easier to follow production combinations, production names use a
prefix-style naming convention.
Each production is given a prefix based on the type of characters it begins and
ends with.

? **`e-`**

: A production matching no characters.

? **`c-`**

: A production starting and ending with a special character.

? **`b-`**

: A production matching a single [line break].

? **`nb-`**

: A production starting and ending with a non-[break] character.

? **`s-`**

: A production starting and ending with a [white space] character.

? **`ns-`**

: A production starting and ending with a non-[space] character.

? **`l-`**

: A production matching complete line(s).

? `X`**`-`**`Y`**`-`**

: A production starting with an `X`**`-`** character and ending with a
`Y`**`-`** character, where `X`**`-`** and `Y`**`-`** are any of the above
prefixes.

? `X`**`+`**, `X`**`-`**`Y`**`+`**

: A production as above, with the additional property that the matched content
[indentation] level is greater than the specified `n` parameter.


<code># Chapter #. Characters</code>

<code>## #. Character Set</code>

To ensure readability, YAML [streams] use only the _printable_ subset of the
Unicode character set.
The allowed character range explicitly excludes the C0 control block[^c0-block]
**`x00-x1F`** (except for TAB **`x09`**, LF **`x0A`** and CR **`x0D`** which
are allowed), DEL **`x7F`**, the C1 control block **`x80-x9F`** (except for NEL
**`x85`** which is allowed), the surrogate block[^surrogates]
**`xD800-xDFFF`**, **`xFFFE`** and **`xFFFF`**.

On input, a YAML [processor] must accept all characters in this printable
subset.

On output, a YAML [processor] must only produce only characters in this
printable subset.
Characters outside this set must be [presented] using [escape] sequences.
In addition, any allowed characters known to be non-printable should also be
[escaped].

&gt; Note: This isn't mandatory since a full implementation would require
extensive character property tables.

```
[#] c-printable ::=
                         # 8 bit
    x09                  # Tab (\t)
  | x0A                  # Line feed (LF \n)
  | x0D                  # Carriage Return (CR \r)
  | [x20-x7E]            # Printable ASCII
                         # 16 bit
  | x85                  # Next Line (NEL)
  | [xA0-xD7FF]          # Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
  | [xE000-xFFFD]        # Additional Unicode Areas
  | [x010000-x10FFFF]    # 32 bit
```


To ensure [JSON compatibility], YAML [processors] must allow all non-C0
characters inside [quoted scalars].
To ensure readability, non-printable characters should be [escaped] on output,
even inside such [scalars].

&gt; Note: JSON [quoted scalars] cannot span multiple lines or contain [tabs], but
YAML [quoted scalars] can.

```
[#] nb-json ::=
    x09              # Tab character
  | [x20-x10FFFF]    # Non-C0-control characters
```

&gt; Note: The production name `nb-json` means "non-break JSON compatible" here.


<code>## #. Character Encodings</code>

All characters mentioned in this specification are Unicode code points.
Each such code point is written as one or more bytes depending on the
_character encoding_ used.
Note that in UTF-16, characters above **`xFFFF`** are written as four bytes,
using a surrogate pair.

The character encoding is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.

On input, a YAML [processor] must support the UTF-8 and UTF-16 character
encodings.
For [JSON compatibility], the UTF-32 encodings must also be supported.

If a character [stream] begins with a _byte order mark_, the character encoding
will be taken to be as indicated by the byte order mark.
Otherwise, the [stream] must begin with an ASCII character.
This allows the encoding to be deduced by the pattern of null (**`x00`**)
characters.

Byte order marks may appear at the start of any [document], however all
[documents] in the same [stream] must use the same character encoding.

To allow for [JSON compatibility], byte order marks are also allowed inside
[quoted scalars].
For readability, such [content] byte order marks should be [escaped] on output.

The encoding can therefore be deduced by matching the first few bytes of the
[stream] with the following table rows (in order):


|                       | Byte0 | Byte1 | Byte2 | Byte3 | Encoding
| --                    | --    | --    | --    | --    | --
| Explicit BOM          | x00   | x00   | xFE   | xFF   | UTF-32BE
| ASCII first character | x00   | x00   | x00   | any   | UTF-32BE
| Explicit BOM          | xFF   | xFE   | x00   | x00   | UTF-32LE
| ASCII first character | any   | x00   | x00   | x00   | UTF-32LE
| Explicit BOM          | xFE   | xFF   |       |       | UTF-16BE
| ASCII first character | x00   | any   |       |       | UTF-16BE
| Explicit BOM          | xFF   | xFE   |       |       | UTF-16LE
| ASCII first character | any   | x00   |       |       | UTF-16LE
| Explicit BOM          | xEF   | xBB   | xBF   |       | UTF-8
| Default               |       |       |       |       | UTF-8


The recommended output encoding is UTF-8.
If another encoding is used, it is recommended that an explicit byte order mark
be used, even if the first [stream] character is ASCII.

For more information about the byte order mark and the Unicode character
encoding schemes see the Unicode FAQ[^uni-faq].

```

[#] c-anchor ::= '&amp;'
```

["**`*`**"] (**`x2A`**, asterisk) denotes an [alias node].


```
[#] c-alias ::= '*'
```


The ["**`!`**"] (**`x21`**, exclamation) is heavily overloaded for specifying
[node tags].
It is used to denote [tag handles] used in [tag directives] and [tag
properties]; to denote [local tags]; and as the [non-specific tag] for
non-[plain scalars].

```
[#] c-tag ::= '!'
```


<code>**Example #. Node Property Indicators**</code>

```
anchored: !local &amp;anchor value
alias: *anchor
```

```
{ "anchored": !local &amp;A1 "value",
  "alias": *A1 }

["**`|`**"] (**`7C`**, vertical bar) denotes a [literal block scalar].

```
[#] c-literal ::= '|'
```


["**`&gt;`**"] (**`x3E`**, greater than) denotes a [folded block scalar].

```
[#] c-folded ::= '&gt;'
```


<code>**Example #. Block Scalar Indicators**</code>

```
literal: |

```
{ "literal": "some\ntext\n",
  "folded": "some text\n" }

["**`'`**"] (**`x27`**, apostrophe, single quote) surrounds a [single-quoted
flow scalar].


```
[#] c-single-quote ::= "'"
```


["**`"`**"] (**`x22`**, double quote) surrounds a [double-quoted flow scalar].

```
[#] c-double-quote ::= '"'
```


<code>**Example #. Quoted Scalar Indicators**</code>

["**`%`**"] (**`x25`**, percent) denotes a [directive] line.

```
[#] c-directive ::= '%'

&lt;!-- Reserved_indicators --&gt;


Any indicator character:

```
[#] c-indicator ::=
    c-sequence-entry    # '-'
  | c-mapping-key       # '?'
  | c-mapping-value     # ':'
  | c-collect-entry     # ','
  | c-sequence-start    # '['
  | c-sequence-end      # ']'
  | c-mapping-start     # '{'
  | c-mapping-end       # '}'
  | c-comment           # '#'

  | c-double-quote      # '"'
  | c-directive         # '%'
  | c-reserved          # '@' '`'
```


The ["**`[`**"], ["**`]`**"], ["**`{`**"], ["**`}`**"] and ["**`,`**"]
indicators denote structure in [flow collections].
They are therefore forbidden in some cases, to avoid ambiguity in several
constructs.
This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.

```
[#] c-flow-indicator ::=
    c-collect-entry     # ','
  | c-sequence-start    # '['
  | c-sequence-end      # ']'
  | c-mapping-start     # '{'
  | c-mapping-end       # '}'
```


<code>## #. Line Break Characters</code>

YAML recognizes the following ASCII _line break_ characters.

```
[#] b-line-feed ::= x0A
```


```
[#] b-carriage-return ::= x0D
```


```
[#] b-char ::=
    b-line-feed          # x0A
  | b-carriage-return    # X0D
```


All other characters, including the form feed (**`x0C`**), are considered to be
non-break characters.
Note that these include the _non-ASCII line breaks_: next line (**`x85`**),
line separator (**`x2028`**) and paragraph separator (**`x2029`**).

[YAML version 1.1] did support the above non-ASCII line break characters;
however, JSON does not.
Hence, to ensure [JSON compatibility], YAML treats them as non-break characters
as of version 1.2.
In theory this would cause incompatibility with [version 1.1]; in practice
these characters were rarely (if ever) used.
YAML 1.2 [processors] [parsing] a [version 1.1] [document] should therefore
treat these line breaks as non-break characters, with an appropriate warning.

```
[#] nb-char ::=
  c-printable - b-char - c-byte-order-mark
```


Line breaks are interpreted differently by different systems and have multiple
widely used formats.

```
[#] b-break ::=
    ( b-carriage-return  # x0A
      b-line-feed
    )                    # x0D
  | b-carriage-return
  | b-line-feed
```


Line breaks inside [scalar content] must be _normalized_ by the YAML
[processor].
Each such line break must be [parsed] into a single line feed character.
The original line break format is a [presentation detail] and must not be used
to convey [content] information.

```
[#] b-as-line-feed ::=
  b-break
```


Outside [scalar content], YAML allows any line break to be used to terminate
lines.

```
[#] b-non-content ::=
  b-break
```


On output, a YAML [processor] is free to emit line breaks using whatever
convention is most appropriate.

In the examples, line breaks are sometimes displayed using the "**`↓`**" glyph
for clarity.


<code>**Example #. Line Break Characters**</code>

```
|
  Line break (no glyph)
  Line break (glyphed)↓
```

```
"Line break (no glyph)\nLine break (glyphed)\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [b-break] &lt;!-- ↓ --&gt;


<code>## #. White Space Characters</code>

YAML recognizes two _white space_ characters: _space_ and _tab_.

```
[#] s-space ::= x20
```

```
[#] s-tab ::= x09
```

```
[#] s-white ::=
  s-space | s-tab
```


The rest of the ([printable]) non-[break] characters are considered to be
non-space characters.

```
[#] ns-char ::=
  nb-char - s-white
```


In the examples, tab characters are displayed as the glyph "**`→`**".
Space characters are sometimes displayed as the glyph "**`·`**" for clarity.


<code>**Example #. Tabs and Spaces**</code>

```
<code># Tabs and spaces</code>
quoted:·"Quoted →"
block:→|
··void main() {
··→printf("Hello, world!\n");
··}
```

```
{ "quoted": "Quoted \t",
  "block": "void main()
    {\n\tprintf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");\n}\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [s-space] &lt;!-- ·· · --&gt;
* [s-tab] &lt;!-- → --&gt;


<code>## #. Miscellaneous Characters</code>

The YAML syntax productions make use of the following additional character
classes:

A decimal digit for numbers:

```
[#] ns-dec-digit ::=
  [x30-x39]             # 0-9
```


A hexadecimal digit for [escape sequences]:

```
[#] ns-hex-digit ::=
    ns-dec-digit        # 0-9
  | [x41-x46]           # A-F
  | [x61-x66]           # a-f
```


ASCII letter (alphabetic) characters:

```
[#] ns-ascii-letter ::=
    [x41-x5A]           # A-Z
  | [x61-x7A]           # a-z
```


Word (alphanumeric) characters for identifiers:

```
[#] ns-word-char ::=
    ns-dec-digit        # 0-9
  | ns-ascii-letter     # A-Z a-z
  | '-'                 # '-'
```

URI characters for [tags], as defined in the URI specification[^uri].

By convention, any URI characters other than the allowed printable ASCII
characters are first _encoded_ in UTF-8 and then each byte is _escaped_ using
the _"**`%`**"_ character.
The YAML [processor] must not expand such escaped characters.
[Tag] characters must be preserved and compared exactly as [presented] in the
YAML [stream], without any processing.

```
[#] ns-uri-char ::=
    (
      '%'
      ns-hex-digit{2}
    )
  | ns-word-char
  | '#'
  | ';'
  | '/'
  | '?'
  | ':'
  | '@'
  | '&amp;'
  | '='
  | '+'
  | '$'
  | ','
  | '_'
  | '.'
  | '!'
  | '~'
  | '*'
  | "'"
  | '('
  | ')'
  | '['
  | ']'
```


The ["**`!`**"] character is used to indicate the end of a [named tag handle];
hence its use in [tag shorthands] is restricted.
In addition, such [shorthands] must not contain the ["**`[`**"], ["**`]`**"],
["**`{`**"], ["**`}`**"] and ["**`,`**"] characters.
These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection] structures.

```
[#] ns-tag-char ::=
    ns-uri-char
  - c-tag               # '!'
  - c-flow-indicator
```


<code>## #. Escaped Characters</code>

All non-[printable] characters must be _escaped_.
YAML escape sequences use the _"**`\`**"_ notation common to most modern
computer languages.
Each escape sequence must be [parsed] into the appropriate Unicode character.
The original escape sequence is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.

Note that escape sequences are only interpreted in [double-quoted scalars].
In all other [scalar styles], the "**`\`**" character has no special meaning
and non-[printable] characters are not available.

```
[#] c-escape ::= '\'
```


YAML escape sequences are a superset of C's escape sequences:

Escaped ASCII null (**`x00`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-null ::= '0'
```


Escaped ASCII bell (**`x07`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-bell ::= 'a'
```


Escaped ASCII backspace (**`x08`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-backspace ::= 'b'
```


Escaped ASCII horizontal tab (**`x09`**) character.
This is useful at the start or the end of a line to force a leading or trailing
tab to become part of the [content].

```
[#] ns-esc-horizontal-tab ::=
  't' | x09
```


Escaped ASCII line feed (**`x0A`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-line-feed ::= 'n'
```


Escaped ASCII vertical tab (**`x0B`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-vertical-tab ::= 'v'
```


Escaped ASCII form feed (**`x0C`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-form-feed ::= 'f'
```


Escaped ASCII carriage return (**`x0D`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-carriage-return ::= 'r'
```


Escaped ASCII escape (**`x1B`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-escape ::= 'e'
```


Escaped ASCII space (**`x20`**) character.
This is useful at the start or the end of a line to force a leading or trailing
space to become part of the [content].

```
[#] ns-esc-space ::= x20
```


Escaped ASCII double quote (**`x22`**).

```
[#] ns-esc-double-quote ::= '"'
```


Escaped ASCII slash (**`x2F`**), for [JSON compatibility].

```
[#] ns-esc-slash ::= '/'
```


Escaped ASCII back slash (**`x5C`**).

```
[#] ns-esc-backslash ::= '\'
```


Escaped Unicode next line (**`x85`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-next-line ::= 'N'
```


Escaped Unicode non-breaking space (**`xA0`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-non-breaking-space ::= '_'
```


Escaped Unicode line separator (**`x2028`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-line-separator ::= 'L'
```


Escaped Unicode paragraph separator (**`x2029`**) character.

```
[#] ns-esc-paragraph-separator ::= 'P'
```


Escaped 8-bit Unicode character.

```
[#] ns-esc-8-bit ::=
  'x'
  ns-hex-digit{2}
```


Escaped 16-bit Unicode character.

```
[#] ns-esc-16-bit ::=
  'u'
  ns-hex-digit{4}
```


Escaped 32-bit Unicode character.

```
[#] ns-esc-32-bit ::=
  'U'
  ns-hex-digit{8}
```


Any escaped character:

```
[#] c-ns-esc-char ::=
  c-escape         # '\'
  (
      ns-esc-null
    | ns-esc-bell

<code># Chapter #. Basic Structures</code>

<code>## #. Indentation Spaces</code>

In YAML [block styles], structure is determined by _indentation_.
In general, indentation is defined as a zero or more [space] characters at the
start of a line.

To maintain portability, [tab] characters must not be used in indentation,
since different systems treat [tabs] differently.
Note that most modern editors may be configured so that pressing the [tab] key
results in the insertion of an appropriate number of [spaces].

The amount of indentation is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.

```
[#]
s-indent(-1) ::=
  &lt;impossible&gt;

s-indent(0) ::=
  &lt;empty&gt;

s-indent(n+1) ::=
  s-space s-indent(n)
```


A [block style] construct is terminated when encountering a line which is less
indented than the construct.
The productions use the notation "**`s-indent-less-than(n)`**" and
"**`s-indent-less-or-equal(n)`**" to express this.

```
[#]
s-indent-less-than(-1) ::=
  &lt;impossible&gt;

s-indent-less-than(0) ::=
  &lt;impossible&gt;

s-indent-less-than(1) ::=
  &lt;empty&gt;

s-indent-less-than(n+2) ::=
  s-indent-less-than(n+1) s-space?
```

```
[#]
s-indent-less-or-equal(-1) ::=
  &lt;impossible&gt;

s-indent-less-or-equal(0) ::=
  &lt;empty&gt;

s-indent-less-or-equal(n+1) ::=
  s-indent-less-or-equal(n) s-space?
```


Each [node] must be indented further than its parent [node].
All sibling [nodes] must use the exact same indentation level.
However the [content] of each sibling [node] may be further indented
independently.


<code>**Example #. Indentation Spaces**</code>

```
··# Leading comment line spaces are
···# neither content nor indentation.
····
Not indented:
·By one space: |
····By four
······spaces
·Flow style: [    # Leading spaces
···By two,        # in flow style
··Also by two,    # are neither
··→Still by two   # content nor
····]             # indentation.
```

```
{ "Not indented": {
    "By one space": "By four\n  spaces\n",
    "Flow style": [
      "By two",
      "Also by two",
      "Still by two" ] } }
```

**Legend:**
* [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 5:1 6:1,4 7:1,4 8:1 9:1,2 10:1,2 11:1,2 12:1,2 --&gt;
* Content &lt;!-- 7:5,2 --&gt;
* Neither content nor indentation &lt;!-- 1:1,2 2:1,3 3 9:3 12:3,2 --&gt;


The ["**`-`**"], ["**`?`**"] and ["**`:`**"] characters used to denote [block
collection] entries are perceived by people to be part of the indentation.
This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.


<code>**Example #. Indentation Indicators**</code>

```
?·a
:·-→b
··-··-→c
·····-·d
```

```
{ "a":
  [ "b",
    [ "c",
      "d" ] ] }
```

**Legend:**
* Total Indentation &lt;!-- 1:1 2:1,3 3:1,6 4:1,6 --&gt;
* [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 2:2 3:1,2 3:4,2 4:1,5 --&gt;
* Indicator as indentation &lt;!-- 1:1 2:1 2:3 3:3 3:6 4:6 --&gt;


<code>## #. Separation Spaces</code>

Outside [indentation] and [scalar content], YAML uses [white space] characters
for _separation_ between tokens within a line.
Note that such [white space] may safely include [tab] characters.

Separation spaces are a [presentation detail] and must not be used to convey
[content] information.

```
[#] s-separate-in-line ::=
    s-white+
  | &lt;start of line&gt;
```


<code>**Example #. Separation Spaces**</code>

```
-·foo:→·bar
- -·baz
  -→baz
```

```
[ { "foo": "bar" },
  [ "baz",
    "baz" ] ]
```

**Legend:**
* [s-separate-in-line] &lt;!-- →· · → --&gt;


<code>## #. Line Prefixes</code>

Inside [scalar content], each line begins with a non-[content] _line prefix_.
This prefix always includes the [indentation].
For [flow scalar styles] it additionally includes all leading [white space],
which may contain [tab] characters.

Line prefixes are a [presentation detail] and must not be used to convey
[content] information.

```
[#] s-line-prefix(n,BLOCK-OUT) ::= s-block-line-prefix(n)
    s-line-prefix(n,BLOCK-IN)  ::= s-block-line-prefix(n)
    s-line-prefix(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= s-flow-line-prefix(n)
    s-line-prefix(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= s-flow-line-prefix(n)
```

```
[#] s-block-line-prefix(n) ::=
  s-indent(n)
```

```
[#] s-flow-line-prefix(n) ::=
  s-indent(n)
  s-separate-in-line?
```


<code>**Example #. Line Prefixes**</code>

```
plain: text
··lines
quoted: "text
··→lines"
block: |
··text
···→lines
```

```
{ "plain": "text lines",
  "quoted": "text lines",
  "block": "text\n \tlines\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [s-flow-line-prefix(n)] &lt;!-- 2:1,2 4:1,3 --&gt;
* [s-block-line-prefix(n)] &lt;!-- 6:1,2 7:1,2 --&gt;
* [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 2:1 4:1 6:1,2 7:1,2 --&gt;


<code>## #. Empty Lines</code>

An _empty line_ line consists of the non-[content] [prefix] followed by a [line
break].

```
[#] l-empty(n,c) ::=
  (
      s-line-prefix(n,c)
    | s-indent-less-than(n)
  )
  b-as-line-feed
```

The semantics of empty lines depend on the [scalar style] they appear in.
This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.


<code>**Example #. Empty Lines**</code>

```
Folding:
  "Empty line
···→
  as a line feed"
Chomping: |
  Clipped empty lines
·
```

```
{ "Folding": "Empty line\nas a line feed",
  "Chomping": "Clipped empty lines\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [l-empty(n,c)] &lt;!-- 3 7 --&gt;


<code>## #. Line Folding</code>

_Line folding_ allows long lines to be broken for readability, while retaining
the semantics of the original long line.
If a [line break] is followed by an [empty line], it is _trimmed_; the first
[line break] is discarded and the rest are retained as [content].

```
[#] b-l-trimmed(n,c) ::=
  b-non-content
  l-empty(n,c)+
```


Otherwise (the following line is not [empty]), the [line break] is converted to
a single [space] (**`x20`**).

```
[#] b-as-space ::=
  b-break
```


A folded non-[empty line] may end with either of the above [line breaks].

```
[#] b-l-folded(n,c) ::=
  b-l-trimmed(n,c) | b-as-space
```


<code>**Example #. Line Folding**</code>

```
&gt;-
  trimmed↓
··↓
·↓
↓
  as↓
  space
```

```
"trimmed\n\n\nas space"
```

**Legend:**
* [b-l-trimmed(n,c)] &lt;!-- 2:10 3 4 5 --&gt;
* [b-as-space] &lt;!-- 6:5 --&gt;


The above rules are common to both the [folded block style] and the [scalar
flow styles].
Folding does distinguish between these cases in the following way:


? Block Folding

: In the [folded block style], the final [line break] and trailing [empty
lines] are subject to [chomping] and are never folded.
In addition, folding does not apply to [line breaks] surrounding text lines
that contain leading [white space].
Note that such a [more-indented] line may consist only of such leading [white
space].

: The combined effect of the _block line folding_ rules is that each
"paragraph" is interpreted as a line, [empty lines] are interpreted as a line
feed and the formatting of [more-indented] lines is preserved.


<code>**Example #. Block Folding**</code>

```
&gt;
··foo·↓
·↓
··→·bar↓
↓
··baz↓
```

```
"foo \n\n\t bar\n\nbaz\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [b-l-folded(n,c)] &lt;!-- 2:7 3:1,2 4:8 5:1 --&gt;
* Non-content spaces &lt;!-- 2:1,2 4:1,2 6:1,2 --&gt;
* Content spaces &lt;!-- 2:6 4:3,2 --&gt;


? Flow Folding

: Folding in [flow styles] provides more relaxed semantics.
[Flow styles] typically depend on explicit [indicators] rather than
[indentation] to convey structure.
Hence spaces preceding or following the text in a line are a [presentation
detail] and must not be used to convey [content] information.
Once all such spaces have been discarded, all [line breaks] are folded without
exception.

: The combined effect of the _flow line folding_ rules is that each "paragraph"
is interpreted as a line, [empty lines] are interpreted as line feeds and text
can be freely [more-indented] without affecting the [content] information.

<code>## #. Comments</code>

An explicit _comment_ is marked by a _"**`#`**" indicator_.
Comments are a [presentation detail] and must not be used to convey [content]
information.

Comments must be [separated] from other tokens by [white space] characters.
To ensure [JSON compatibility], YAML [processors] must allow for the omission
of the final comment [line break] of the input [stream].
However, as this confuses many tools, YAML [processors] should terminate the
[stream] with an explicit [line break] on output.

```
[#] c-nb-comment-text ::=
  c-comment    # '#'
  nb-char*
```

```
[#] b-comment ::=
    b-non-content
  | &lt;end of input&gt;
```

```
[#] s-b-comment ::=
  (
    s-separate-in-line
    c-nb-comment-text?
  )?
  b-comment
```


<code>**Example #. Separated Comment**</code>

```
key:····# Comment↓

```
{ "key": "value" }
```

**Legend:**

* [b-comment] &lt;!-- ↓ 2:8,5 --&gt;
* [s-b-comment] &lt;!-- 1:5, 2:8,5 --&gt;


Outside [scalar content], comments may appear on a line of their own,
independent of the [indentation] level.
Note that outside [scalar content], a line containing only [white space]
characters is taken to be a comment line.

```
[#] l-comment ::=
  s-separate-in-line
  c-nb-comment-text?
  b-comment
```


<code>**Example #. Comment Lines**</code>

```
··# Comment↓

```

**Legend:**
* [s-b-comment] &lt;!-- 1:3, 2:4 3 --&gt;
* [l-comment] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 --&gt;


In most cases, when a line may end with a comment, YAML allows it to be
followed by additional comment lines.
The only exception is a comment ending a [block scalar header].

```
[#] s-l-comments ::=
  (
      s-b-comment
    | &lt;start of line&gt;
  )
  l-comment*
```


<code>**Example #. Multi-Line Comments**</code>

```

* [l-comment] &lt;!-- 2 4 --&gt;
* [s-l-comments] &lt;!-- 1:5, 2 3:8 4 --&gt;


<code>## #. Separation Lines</code>

[Implicit keys] are restricted to a single line.
In all other cases, YAML allows tokens to be separated by multi-line (possibly
empty) [comments].

Note that structures following multi-line comment separation must be properly
[indented], even though there is no such restriction on the separation
[comment] lines themselves.

```
[#] s-separate(n,BLOCK-OUT) ::= s-separate-lines(n)
    s-separate(n,BLOCK-IN)  ::= s-separate-lines(n)
    s-separate(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= s-separate-lines(n)
    s-separate(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= s-separate-lines(n)
    s-separate(n,BLOCK-KEY) ::= s-separate-in-line

* [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 3:1,2 4:1,3 5:1,2 6:1,3 --&gt;


<code>## #. Directives</code>

_Directives_ are instructions to the YAML [processor].
This specification defines two directives, ["**`YAML`**"] and ["**`TAG`**"],
and _reserves_ all other directives for future use.
There is no way to define private directives.
This is intentional.

Directives are a [presentation detail] and must not be used to convey [content]
information.

```
[#] l-directive ::=
  c-directive            # '%'
  (
      ns-yaml-directive
    | ns-tag-directive
    | ns-reserved-directive
  )
  s-l-comments
```


Each directive is specified on a separate non-[indented] line starting with the
_"**`%`**" indicator_, followed by the directive name and a list of parameters.
The semantics of these parameters depends on the specific directive.
A YAML [processor] should ignore unknown directives with an appropriate
warning.

```
[#] ns-reserved-directive ::=
  ns-directive-name
  (
    s-separate-in-line
    ns-directive-parameter
  )*
```

```
[#] ns-directive-name ::=
  ns-char+
```

```
[#] ns-directive-parameter ::=
  ns-char+
```


<code>**Example #. Reserved Directives**</code>

```
%FOO  bar baz # Should be ignored
               # with a warning.
--- "foo"
```

```
"foo"
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-reserved-directive] &lt;!-- 1:2,12 --&gt;
* [ns-directive-name] &lt;!-- 1:2,3 --&gt;
* [ns-directive-parameter] &lt;!-- 1:7,3 1:11,3 --&gt;


<code>### #. "**`YAML`**" Directives</code>

The _"**`YAML`**" directive_ specifies the version of YAML the [document]
conforms to.
This specification defines version "**`1.2`**", including recommendations for
_YAML 1.1 processing_.

A version 1.2 YAML [processor] must accept [documents] with an explicit
"**`%YAML 1.2`**" directive, as well as [documents] lacking a "**`YAML`**"
directive.
Such [documents] are assumed to conform to the 1.2 version specification.
[Documents] with a "**`YAML`**" directive specifying a higher minor version
(e.g. "**`%YAML 1.3`**") should be processed with an appropriate warning.
[Documents] with a "**`YAML`**" directive specifying a higher major version
(e.g. "**`%YAML 2.0`**") should be rejected with an appropriate error message.

A version 1.2 YAML [processor] must also accept [documents] with an explicit
"**`%YAML 1.1`**" directive.
Note that version 1.2 is mostly a superset of version 1.1, defined for the
purpose of ensuring _JSON compatibility_.
Hence a version 1.2 [processor] should process version 1.1 [documents] as if
they were version 1.2, giving a warning on points of incompatibility (handling
of [non-ASCII line breaks], as described [above]).

```
[#] ns-yaml-directive ::=
  "YAML"
  s-separate-in-line
  ns-yaml-version
```

```
[#] ns-yaml-version ::=
  ns-dec-digit+
  '.'
  ns-dec-digit+
```


<code>**Example #. "**`YAML`**" directive**</code>

```
%YAML 1.3 # Attempt parsing
           # with a warning
---
"foo"
```

```
"foo"
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-yaml-directive] &lt;!-- 1:2,8 --&gt;
* [ns-yaml-version] &lt;!-- 1:7,3 --&gt;


It is an error to specify more than one "**`YAML`**" directive for the same
document, even if both occurrences give the same version number.


<code>**Example #. Invalid Repeated YAML directive**</code>

```
%YAML 1.2
%YAML 1.1
foo
```
&lt;!-- 2:2,4 --&gt;

```
ERROR:
The YAML directive must only be
given at most once per document.
```
&lt;!-- 2:5,4 --&gt;


<code>### #. "**`TAG`**" Directives</code>

The _"**`TAG`**" directive_ establishes a [tag shorthand] notation for
specifying [node tags].
Each "**`TAG`**" directive associates a [handle] with a [prefix].
This allows for compact and readable [tag] notation.

```
[#] ns-tag-directive ::=
  "TAG"
  s-separate-in-line
  c-tag-handle
  s-separate-in-line
  ns-tag-prefix
```


<code>**Example #. "**`TAG`**" directive**</code>

```
%TAG !yaml! tag:yaml.org,2002:
---
!yaml!str "foo"
```

```
"foo"
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-tag-directive] &lt;!-- 1:2, --&gt;
* [c-tag-handle] &lt;!-- 1:6,6 --&gt;
* [ns-tag-prefix] &lt;!-- 1:13, --&gt;


It is an error to specify more than one "**`TAG`**" directive for the same
[handle] in the same document, even if both occurrences give the same [prefix].


<code>**Example #. Invalid Repeated TAG directive**</code>

```
%TAG ! !foo
%TAG ! !foo
bar
```
&lt;!-- 2:6 --&gt;

```
ERROR:
The TAG directive must only
be given at most once per
handle in the same document.
```
&lt;!-- 4:1,6 --&gt;


<code>#### #. Tag Handles</code>

The _tag handle_ exactly matches the prefix of the affected [tag shorthand].
There are three tag handle variants:

```
[#] c-tag-handle ::=
    c-named-tag-handle
  | c-secondary-tag-handle
  | c-primary-tag-handle
```


? Primary Handle

: The _primary tag handle_ is a single _"**`!`**"_ character.
This allows using the most compact possible notation for a single "primary"
name space.
By default, the prefix associated with this handle is ["**`!`**"].
Thus, by default, [shorthands] using this handle are interpreted as [local
tags].

: It is possible to override the default behavior by providing an explicit
"**`TAG`**" directive, associating a different prefix for this handle.
This provides smooth migration from using [local tags] to using [global tags]
by the simple addition of a single "**`TAG`**" directive.

```
[#] c-primary-tag-handle ::= '!'
```


<code>**Example #. Primary Tag Handle**</code>

```
<code># Private</code>
!foo "bar"
...
<code># Global</code>
%TAG ! tag:example.com,2000:app/
---
!foo "bar"
```

```
!&lt;!foo&gt; "bar"
---
!&lt;tag:example.com,2000:app/foo&gt; "bar"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-primary-tag-handle] &lt;!-- ! --&gt;


? Secondary Handle

: The _secondary tag handle_ is written as _"**`!!`**"_.
This allows using a compact notation for a single "secondary" name space.
By default, the prefix associated with this handle is
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:`**".

: It is possible to override this default behavior by providing an explicit
"**`TAG`**" directive associating a different prefix for this handle.

```
[#] c-secondary-tag-handle ::= "!!"
```


<code>**Example #. Secondary Tag Handle**</code>

```
%TAG !! tag:example.com,2000:app/
---
!!int 1 - 3 # Interval, not integer
```

```
!&lt;tag:example.com,2000:app/int&gt; "1 - 3"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-secondary-tag-handle] &lt;!-- !! --&gt;


? Named Handles

: A _named tag handle_ surrounds a non-empty name with _"**`!`**"_ characters.
A handle name must not be used in a [tag shorthand] unless an explicit
"**`TAG`**" directive has associated some prefix with it.

: The name of the handle is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.
In particular, the YAML [processor] need not preserve the handle name once
[parsing] is completed.

```
[#] c-named-tag-handle ::=
  c-tag            # '!'
  ns-word-char+
  c-tag            # '!'
```


<code>**Example #. Tag Handles**</code>

```
%TAG !e! tag:example.com,2000:app/
---
!e!foo "bar"
```

```
!&lt;tag:example.com,2000:app/foo&gt; "bar"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-named-tag-handle] &lt;!-- !e! --&gt;


<code>#### #. Tag Prefixes</code>

There are two _tag prefix_ variants:

```
[#] ns-tag-prefix ::=
  c-ns-local-tag-prefix | ns-global-tag-prefix
```


? Local Tag Prefix

: If the prefix begins with a ["**`!`**"] character, [shorthands] using the
[handle] are expanded to a [local tag].
Note that such a [tag] is intentionally not a valid URI and its semantics are
specific to the [application].
In particular, two [documents] in the same [stream] may assign different
semantics to the same [local tag].

```
[#] c-ns-local-tag-prefix ::=
  c-tag           # '!'
  ns-uri-char*
```


<code>**Example #. Local Tag Prefix**</code>

```
%TAG !m! !my-
--- # Bulb here
!m!light fluorescent
...
%TAG !m! !my-
--- # Color here
!m!light green
```

```
!&lt;!my-light&gt; "fluorescent"
---
!&lt;!my-light&gt; "green"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-ns-local-tag-prefix] &lt;!-- !my- --&gt;


? Global Tag Prefix

: If the prefix begins with a character other than ["**`!`**"], it must be a
valid URI prefix, and should contain at least the scheme.
[Shorthands] using the associated [handle] are expanded to globally unique URI
tags and their semantics is consistent across [applications].
In particular, every [document] in every [stream] must assign the same
semantics to the same [global tag].

```
[#] ns-global-tag-prefix ::=
  ns-tag-char
  ns-uri-char*
```


<code>**Example #. Global Tag Prefix**</code>

```
%TAG !e! tag:example.com,2000:app/
---
- !e!foo "bar"
```

```
- !&lt;tag:example.com,2000:app/foo&gt; "bar"
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-global-tag-prefix] &lt;!-- tag:example.com,2000:app/ --&gt;


<code>## #. Node Properties</code>

Each [node] may have two optional _properties_, [anchor] and [tag], in addition
to its [content].
Node properties may be specified in any order before the [node's content].
Either or both may be omitted.

```
[#] c-ns-properties(n,c) ::=
    (
      c-ns-tag-property
      (
        s-separate(n,c)
        c-ns-anchor-property
      )?
    )
  | (
      c-ns-anchor-property
      (
        s-separate(n,c)
        c-ns-tag-property
      )?
    )
```


<code>**Example #. Node Properties**</code>

```
!!str &amp;a1 "foo":
  !!str bar
&amp;a2 baz : *a1
```

```
{ &amp;B1 "foo": "bar",
  "baz": *B1 }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-ns-properties(n,c)] &lt;!-- 1:1,9 2:3,5 3:1,3 --&gt;
* [c-ns-anchor-property] &lt;!-- 1:7,3 3:1,3 --&gt;
* [c-ns-tag-property] &lt;!-- 1:1,5 2:3,5 --&gt;


<code>### #. Node Tags</code>

The _tag property_ identifies the type of the [native data structure]
[presented] by the [node].
A tag is denoted by the _"**`!`**" indicator_.

```
[#] c-ns-tag-property ::=
    c-verbatim-tag
  | c-ns-shorthand-tag
  | c-non-specific-tag
```


? Verbatim Tags

: A tag may be written _verbatim_ by surrounding it with the _"**`&lt;`**" and
"**`&gt;`**"_ characters.
In this case, the YAML [processor] must deliver the verbatim tag as-is to the
[application].
In particular, verbatim tags are not subject to [tag resolution].
A verbatim tag must either begin with a ["**`!`**"] (a [local tag]) or be a
valid URI (a [global tag]).

```
[#] c-verbatim-tag ::=
  "!&lt;"
  ns-uri-char+
  '&gt;'
```


<code>**Example #. Verbatim Tags**</code>

```
!&lt;tag:yaml.org,2002:str&gt; foo :
  !&lt;!bar&gt; baz
```

```
{ "foo": !&lt;!bar&gt; "baz" }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-verbatim-tag] &lt;!-- !&lt;tag:yaml.org,2002:str&gt; !&lt;!bar&gt; --&gt;


<code>**Example #. Invalid Verbatim Tags**</code>

```
- !&lt;!&gt; foo
- !&lt;$:?&gt; bar
```
&lt;!-- 1:5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2:5,3 --&gt;

```
ERROR:
- Verbatim tags aren't resolved,
  so ! is invalid.
- The $:? tag is neither a global
  URI tag nor a local tag starting
  with '!'.
```
&lt;!-- 3:6 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 4:7,3 --&gt;


? Tag Shorthands

: A _tag shorthand_ consists of a valid [tag handle] followed by a non-empty
suffix.
The [tag handle] must be associated with a [prefix], either by default or by
using a ["**`TAG`**" directive].
The resulting [parsed] [tag] is the concatenation of the [prefix] and the
suffix and must either begin with ["**`!`**"] (a [local tag]) or be a valid URI
(a [global tag]).

: The choice of [tag handle] is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.
In particular, the [tag handle] may be discarded once [parsing] is completed.

: The suffix must not contain any ["**`!`**"] character.
This would cause the tag shorthand to be interpreted as having a [named tag
handle].
In addition, the suffix must not contain the ["**`[`**"], ["**`]`**"],
["**`{`**"], ["**`}`**"] and ["**`,`**"] characters.
These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection] structures.
If the suffix needs to specify any of the above restricted characters, they
must be [escaped] using the ["**`%`**"] character.
This behavior is consistent with the URI character escaping rules
(specifically, section 2.3 of URI RFC).

```
[#] c-ns-shorthand-tag ::=
  c-tag-handle
  ns-tag-char+
```


<code>**Example #. Tag Shorthands**</code>

```
%TAG !e! tag:example.com,2000:app/
---
- !local foo
- !!str bar
- !e!tag%21 baz
```

```
[ !&lt;!local&gt; "foo",
  !&lt;tag:yaml.org,2002:str&gt; "bar",
  !&lt;tag:example.com,2000:app/tag!&gt; "baz" ]
```

**Legend:**
* [c-ns-shorthand-tag] &lt;!-- !local !!str !e!tag%21 --&gt;


<code>**Example #. Invalid Tag Shorthands**</code>

```
%TAG !e! tag:example,2000:app/
---
- !e! foo
- !h!bar baz
```
&lt;!-- 3:3,3 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 4:3,3 --&gt;

```
ERROR:
- The !e! handle has no suffix.
- The !h! handle wasn't declared.
```
&lt;!-- 2:7,3 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 3:7,3 --&gt;


? Non-Specific Tags

: If a [node] has no tag property, it is assigned a [non-specific tag] that
needs to be [resolved] to a [specific] one.
This [non-specific tag] is ["**`!`**"] for non-[plain scalars] and ["**`?`**"]
for all other [nodes].
This is the only case where the [node style] has any effect on the [content]
information.

: It is possible for the tag property to be explicitly set to the ["**`!`**"
non-specific tag].
By [convention], this "disables" [tag resolution], forcing the [node] to be
interpreted as "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**", "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" or
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**", according to its [kind].

: There is no way to explicitly specify the ["**`?`**" non-specific] tag.
This is intentional.

```
[#] c-non-specific-tag ::= '!'
```


<code>**Example #. Non-Specific Tags**</code>

```
<code># Assuming conventional resolution:</code>
- "12"
- 12
- ! 12
```

```
[ "12",
  12,
  "12" ]
```

**Legend:**
* [c-non-specific-tag] &lt;!-- ! --&gt;


<code>### #. Node Anchors</code>

An anchor is denoted by the _"**`&amp;`**" indicator_.
It marks a [node] for future reference.
An [alias node] can then be used to indicate additional inclusions of the
anchored [node].
An anchored [node] need not be referenced by any [alias nodes]; in particular,
it is valid for all [nodes] to be anchored.

```
[#] c-ns-anchor-property ::=
  c-anchor          # '&amp;'
  ns-anchor-name
```


Note that as a [serialization detail], the anchor name is preserved in the
[serialization tree].
However, it is not reflected in the [representation] graph and must not be used
to convey [content] information.
In particular, the YAML [processor] need not preserve the anchor name once the
[representation] is [composed].

Anchor names must not contain the ["**`[`**"], ["**`]`**"], ["**`{`**"],
["**`}`**"] and ["**`,`**"] characters.
These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection] structures.

```
[#] ns-anchor-char ::=
    ns-char - c-flow-indicator
```

```
[#] ns-anchor-name ::=
  ns-anchor-char+
```


<code>**Example #. Node Anchors**</code>

```
First occurrence: &amp;anchor Value
Second occurrence: *anchor
```

```
{ "First occurrence": &amp;A "Value",
  "Second occurrence": *A }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-ns-anchor-property] &lt;!-- 1:19,7 --&gt;
* [ns-anchor-name] &lt;!-- 1:20,6 2:21,6 --&gt;


<code># Chapter #. Flow Styles</code>

YAML's _flow styles_ can be thought of as the natural extension of JSON to
cover [folding] long content lines for readability, [tagging] nodes to control
[construction] of [native data structures] and using [anchors] and [aliases] to
reuse [constructed] object instances.


<code>## #. Alias Nodes</code>

Subsequent occurrences of a previously [serialized] node are [presented] as
_alias nodes_.
The first occurrence of the [node] must be marked by an [anchor] to allow
subsequent occurrences to be [presented] as alias nodes.

An alias node is denoted by the _"**`*`**" indicator_.
The alias refers to the most recent preceding [node] having the same [anchor].
It is an error for an alias node to use an [anchor] that does not previously
occur in the [document].
It is not an error to specify an [anchor] that is not used by any alias node.

Note that an alias node must not specify any [properties] or [content], as
these were already specified at the first occurrence of the [node].

```
[#] c-ns-alias-node ::=
  c-alias           # '*'
  ns-anchor-name
```


<code>**Example #. Alias Nodes**</code>

```
First occurrence: &amp;anchor Foo
Second occurrence: *anchor
Override anchor: &amp;anchor Bar
Reuse anchor: *anchor
```

```
{ "First occurrence": &amp;A "Foo",
  "Override anchor": &amp;B "Bar",
  "Second occurrence": *A,
  "Reuse anchor": *B }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-ns-alias-node] &lt;!-- 2:20,7 4:15,7 --&gt;
* [ns-anchor-name] &lt;!-- 1:20,6 2:21,6 3:19,6 4:16,6 --&gt;


<code>## #. Empty Nodes</code>

YAML allows the [node content] to be omitted in many cases.
[Nodes] with empty [content] are interpreted as if they were [plain scalars]
with an empty value.
Such [nodes] are commonly resolved to a ["**`null`**"] value.

```
[#] e-scalar ::= ""
```


In the examples, empty [scalars] are sometimes displayed as the glyph "**`°`**"
for clarity.
Note that this glyph corresponds to a position in the characters [stream]
rather than to an actual character.


<code>**Example #. Empty Content**</code>

```
{
  foo : !!str°,
  !!str° : bar,
}
```

```
{ "foo": "",
  "": "bar" }
```

**Legend:**
* [e-scalar] &lt;!-- ° --&gt;


Both the [node's properties] and [node content] are optional.
This allows for a _completely empty node_.
Completely empty nodes are only valid when following some explicit indication
for their existence.

```
[#] e-node ::=
  e-scalar    # ""
```


<code>**Example #. Completely Empty Flow Nodes**</code>

```
{
  ? foo :°,
  °: bar,
}
```

```
{ "foo": null,
  null : "bar" }
```

**Legend:**
* [e-node] &lt;!-- ° --&gt;


<code>## #. Flow Scalar Styles</code>

YAML provides three _flow scalar styles_: [double-quoted], [single-quoted] and
[plain] (unquoted).
Each provides a different trade-off between readability and expressive power.

The [scalar style] is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to convey
[content] information, with the exception that [plain scalars] are
distinguished for the purpose of [tag resolution].


<code>### #. Double-Quoted Style</code>

The _double-quoted style_ is specified by surrounding _"**`"`**" indicators_.
This is the only [style] capable of expressing arbitrary strings, by using
["**`\`**"] [escape sequences].
This comes at the cost of having to escape the ["**`\`**"] and "**`"`**"
characters.

```
[#] nb-double-char ::=
    c-ns-esc-char
  | (
        nb-json
      - c-escape          # '\'
      - c-double-quote    # '"'
    )
```

```
[#] ns-double-char ::=
  nb-double-char - s-white
```


Double-quoted scalars are restricted to a single line when contained inside an
[implicit key].

```
[#] c-double-quoted(n,c) ::=
  c-double-quote         # '"'
  nb-double-text(n,c)
  c-double-quote         # '"'
```

```
[#] nb-double-text(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= nb-double-multi-line(n)
    nb-double-text(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= nb-double-multi-line(n)
    nb-double-text(n,BLOCK-KEY) ::= nb-double-one-line
    nb-double-text(n,FLOW-KEY)  ::= nb-double-one-line
```

```
[#] nb-double-one-line ::=
  nb-double-char*
```


<code>**Example #. Double Quoted Implicit Keys**</code>

```
"implicit block key" : [
  "implicit flow key" : value,
 ]
```

```
{ "implicit block key":
  [ { "implicit flow key": "value" } ] }
```

**Legend:**
* [nb-double-one-line] &lt;!-- 1:2,18 2:4,17 --&gt;
* [c-double-quoted(n,c)] &lt;!-- 1:1,20 2:3,19 --&gt;


In a multi-line double-quoted scalar, [line breaks] are subject to [flow line
folding], which discards any trailing [white space] characters.
It is also possible to _escape_ the [line break] character.
In this case, the [line break] is excluded from the [content] and the trailing
[white space] characters are preserved.
Combined with the ability to [escape] [white space] characters, this allows
double-quoted lines to be broken at arbitrary positions.

```
[#] s-double-escaped(n) ::=
  s-white*
  c-escape         # '\'
  b-non-content
  l-empty(n,FLOW-IN)*
  s-flow-line-prefix(n)
```

```
[#] s-double-break(n) ::=
    s-double-escaped(n)
  | s-flow-folded(n)
```


<code>**Example #. Double Quoted Line Breaks**</code>

```
"folded·↓
to a space,→↓
·↓
to a line feed, or·→\↓
·\·→non-content"
```

```
"folded to a space,\nto a line feed, or \t \tnon-content"
```

**Legend:**
* [s-flow-folded(n)] &lt;!-- ·↓ →↓ --&gt;
* [s-double-escaped(n)] &lt;!-- ·→\↓ 5:1 --&gt;


All leading and trailing [white space] characters are excluded from the
[content].
Each continuation line must therefore contain at least one non-[space]
character.
Empty lines, if any, are consumed as part of the [line folding].

```
[#] nb-ns-double-in-line ::=
  (
    s-white*
    ns-double-char
  )*
```

```
[#] s-double-next-line(n) ::=
  s-double-break(n)
  (
    ns-double-char nb-ns-double-in-line
    (
        s-double-next-line(n)
      | s-white*
    )
  )?
```

```
[#] nb-double-multi-line(n) ::=
  nb-ns-double-in-line
  (
      s-double-next-line(n)
    | s-white*
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Double Quoted Lines**</code>

```
"·1st non-empty↓
↓
·2nd non-empty·
→3rd non-empty·"
```

```
" 1st non-empty\n2nd non-empty 3rd non-empty "
```

**Legend:**
* [nb-ns-double-in-line] &lt;!-- 1:2,14 3:2,13 4:2,13 --&gt;
* [s-double-next-line(n)] &lt;!-- ↓ 3 4:1,14 --&gt;


<code>### #. Single-Quoted Style</code>

The _single-quoted style_ is specified by surrounding _"**`'`**" indicators_.
Therefore, within a single-quoted scalar, such characters need to be repeated.
This is the only form of _escaping_ performed in single-quoted scalars.
In particular, the "**`\`**" and "**`"`**" characters may be freely used.
This restricts single-quoted scalars to [printable] characters.
In addition, it is only possible to break a long single-quoted line where a
[space] character is surrounded by non-[spaces].

```
[#] c-quoted-quote ::= "''"
```

```
[#] nb-single-char ::=
    c-quoted-quote
  | (
        nb-json
      - c-single-quote    # "'"
    )
```

```
[#] ns-single-char ::=
  nb-single-char - s-white
```


<code>**Example #. Single Quoted Characters**</code>

```
'here''s to "quotes"'
```

```
"here's to \"quotes\""
```

**Legend:**
* [c-quoted-quote] &lt;!-- '' --&gt;


Single-quoted scalars are restricted to a single line when contained inside a
[implicit key].

```
[#] c-single-quoted(n,c) ::=
  c-single-quote    # "'"
  nb-single-text(n,c)
  c-single-quote    # "'"
```

```
[#] nb-single-text(FLOW-OUT)  ::= nb-single-multi-line(n)
    nb-single-text(FLOW-IN)   ::= nb-single-multi-line(n)
    nb-single-text(BLOCK-KEY) ::= nb-single-one-line
    nb-single-text(FLOW-KEY)  ::= nb-single-one-line
```

```
[#] nb-single-one-line ::=
  nb-single-char*
```


<code>**Example #. Single Quoted Implicit Keys**</code>

```
'implicit block key' : [
  'implicit flow key' : value,
 ]
```

```
{ "implicit block key":
  [ { "implicit flow key": "value" } ] }
```

**Legend:**
* [nb-single-one-line] &lt;!-- 1:2,18 2:4,17 --&gt;
* [c-single-quoted(n,c)] &lt;!-- 1:1,20 2:3,19 --&gt;


All leading and trailing [white space] characters are excluded from the
[content].
Each continuation line must therefore contain at least one non-[space]
character.
Empty lines, if any, are consumed as part of the [line folding].

```
[#] nb-ns-single-in-line ::=
  (
    s-white*
    ns-single-char
  )*
```

```
[#] s-single-next-line(n) ::=

    nb-ns-single-in-line
    (
        s-single-next-line(n)
      | s-white*
    )
  )?
```

```
[#] nb-single-multi-line(n) ::=
  nb-ns-single-in-line
  (
      s-single-next-line(n)
    | s-white*
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Single Quoted Lines**</code>

```
'·1st non-empty↓
↓
·2nd non-empty·
→3rd non-empty·'
```

```
" 1st non-empty\n2nd non-empty 3rd non-empty "
```

**Legend:**
* [nb-ns-single-in-line(n)] &lt;!-- 1:2,14 3:2,13 4:2,13 --&gt;
* [s-single-next-line(n)] &lt;!-- 1:16 2 3 4:1,14 --&gt;


<code>### #. Plain Style</code>

The _plain_ (unquoted) style has no identifying [indicators] and provides no
form of escaping.
It is therefore the most readable, most limited and most [context] sensitive
[style].
In addition to a restricted character set, a plain scalar must not be empty or
contain leading or trailing [white space] characters.
It is only possible to break a long plain line where a [space] character is
surrounded by non-[spaces].

Plain scalars must not begin with most [indicators], as this would cause
ambiguity with other YAML constructs.
However, the ["**`:`**"], ["**`?`**"] and ["**`-`**"] [indicators] may be used
as the first character if followed by a non-[space] "safe" character, as this
causes no ambiguity.

```
[#] ns-plain-first(c) ::=
    (
        ns-char
      - c-indicator
    )
  | (
      (
          c-mapping-key       # '?'
        | c-mapping-value     #':'
        | c-sequence-entry    #'-'
      )
      [lookahead = ns-plain-safe(c)]
    )
```


Plain scalars must never contain the ["**`:`** "] and [" **`#`**"] character
combinations.
Such combinations would cause ambiguity with [mapping] [key/value pairs] and
[comments].
In addition, inside [flow collections], or when used as [implicit keys], plain
scalars must not contain the ["**`[`**"], ["**`]`**"], ["**`{`**"], ["**`}`**"]
and ["**`,`**"] characters.
These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection] structures.

```
[#] ns-plain-safe(FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-plain-safe-out
    ns-plain-safe(FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-plain-safe-in
    ns-plain-safe(BLOCK-KEY) ::= ns-plain-safe-out
    ns-plain-safe(FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-plain-safe-in
```

```
[#] ns-plain-safe-out ::=
  ns-char
```

```
[#] ns-plain-safe-in ::=
  ns-char - c-flow-indicator
```

```
[#] ns-plain-char(c) ::=
    (
        ns-plain-safe(c)
      - c-mapping-value    # ':'
      - c-comment          # '#'
    )
  | (
      [lookbehind = ns-char]
      c-comment          # '#'
    )
  | (
      c-mapping-value    # ':'
      [lookahead = ns-plain-safe(c)]
    )
```

```

```
[ "::vector",

  "Up, up, and away!",
  -123,
  "http://example.com/foo#bar",
  [ "::vector",
    ": - ()",
    "Up, up, and away!",
    -123,
    "http://example.com/foo#bar" ] ]
```

* Not ns-plain-first(c) &lt;!-- 3:4 9:4 --&gt;
* Not ns-plain-char(c) &lt;!-- 10:6 --&gt;


Plain scalars are further restricted to a single line when contained inside an
[implicit key].

```
[#] ns-plain(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-plain-multi-line(n,FLOW-OUT)
    ns-plain(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-plain-multi-line(n,FLOW-IN)

    ns-plain(n,FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-plain-one-line(FLOW-KEY)
```

```

```
[#] ns-plain-one-line(c) ::=

```

**Legend:**
* [ns-plain-one-line(c)] &lt;!-- 1:1,18 2:3,17 --&gt;


All leading and trailing [white space] characters are excluded from the
[content].
Each continuation line must therefore contain at least one non-[space]
character.
Empty lines, if any, are consumed as part of the [line folding].

```
[#] s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c) ::=
  s-flow-folded(n)
  ns-plain-char(c)
  nb-ns-plain-in-line(c)
```

```

* [s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c)] &lt;!-- 1:14 2 3 4 --&gt;


<code>## #. Flow Collection Styles</code>

A _flow collection_ may be nested within a [block collection] ([**`FLOW-OUT`**
context]), nested within another flow collection ([**`FLOW-IN`** context]) or
be a part of an [implicit key] ([**`FLOW-KEY`** context] or [**`BLOCK-KEY`**
context]).
Flow collection entries are terminated by the _"**`,`**" indicator_.
The final "**`,`**" may be omitted.
This does not cause ambiguity because flow collection entries can never be
[completely empty].

```
[#] in-flow(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-IN)
    in-flow(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-IN)
    in-flow(n,BLOCK-KEY) ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-KEY)
    in-flow(n,FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-KEY)
```


<code>### #. Flow Sequences</code>

_Flow sequence content_ is denoted by surrounding _"**`[`**"_ and _"**`]`**"_
characters.

```
[#] c-flow-sequence(n,c) ::=
  c-sequence-start    # '['
  s-separate(n,c)?
  in-flow(n,c)?
  c-sequence-end      # ']'
```


Sequence entries are separated by a ["**`,`**"] character.

```
[#] ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c)
  s-separate(n,c)?
  (
    c-collect-entry     # ','
    s-separate(n,c)?
    ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,c)?
  )?
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Sequence**</code>

```
- [ one, two, ]
- [three ,four]
```

```
[ [ "one",
    "two" ],
  [ "three",
    "four" ] ]
```

**Legend:**
* [c-sequence-start] [c-sequence-end] &lt;!-- [ ] --&gt;
* [ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c)] &lt;!-- one two three four --&gt;


Any [flow node] may be used as a flow sequence entry.
In addition, YAML provides a [compact notation] for the case where a flow
sequence entry is a [mapping] with a [single key/value pair].

```
[#] ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-pair(n,c) | ns-flow-node(n,c)
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Sequence Entries**</code>

```
[
"double
 quoted", 'single
           quoted',
plain
 text, [ nested ],
single: pair,
]
```

```
[ "double quoted",
  "single quoted",
  "plain text",
  [ "nested" ],
  { "single": "pair" } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-flow-node(n,c)] &lt;!-- 2 3:1,8 3:11, 4:1,18 5 6:1,5 6:8,10 --&gt;
* [ns-flow-pair(n,c)] &lt;!-- 7:1,12 --&gt;


<code>### #. Flow Mappings</code>

_Flow mappings_ are denoted by surrounding _"**`{`**"_ and _"**`}`**"_
characters.

```
[#] c-flow-mapping(n,c) ::=
  c-mapping-start       # '{'
  s-separate(n,c)?
  ns-s-flow-map-entries(n,in-flow(c))?
  c-mapping-end         # '}'
```


Mapping entries are separated by a ["**`,`**"] character.

```
[#] ns-s-flow-map-entries(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-map-entry(n,c)
  s-separate(n,c)?
  (
    c-collect-entry     # ','
    s-separate(n,c)?
    ns-s-flow-map-entries(n,c)?
  )?
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Mappings**</code>

```
- { one : two , three: four , }
- {five: six,seven : eight}
```

```
[ { "one": "two",
    "three": "four" },
  { "five": "six",
    "seven": "eight" } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [c-mapping-start] [c-mapping-end] &lt;!-- { } --&gt;
* [ns-flow-map-entry(n,c)] &lt;!-- one_:_two three:_four five:_six seven_:_eight --&gt;


If the optional _"**`?`**" mapping key indicator_ is specified, the rest of the
entry may be [completely empty].

```
[#] ns-flow-map-entry(n,c) ::=
    (
      c-mapping-key      # '?'
      s-separate(n,c)
      ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c)
    )
  | ns-flow-map-implicit-entry(n,c)
```

```
[#] ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) ::=
    ns-flow-map-implicit-entry(n,c)
  | (
      e-node    # ""
      e-node    # ""
    )
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Mapping Entries**</code>

```
{
? explicit: entry,
implicit: entry,
?°°
}
```

```
{ "explicit": "entry",
  "implicit": "entry",
  null: null }
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c)] &lt;!-- explicit:_entry --&gt;
* [ns-flow-map-implicit-entry(n,c)] &lt;!-- implicit:_entry --&gt;
* [e-node] &lt;!-- ° --&gt;


Normally, YAML insists the _"**`:`**" mapping value indicator_ be [separated]
from the [value] by [white space].
A benefit of this restriction is that the "**`:`**" character can be used
inside [plain scalars], as long as it is not followed by [white space].
This allows for unquoted URLs and timestamps.
It is also a potential source for confusion as "**`a:1`**" is a [plain scalar]
and not a [key/value pair].

Note that the [value] may be [completely empty] since its existence is
indicated by the "**`:`**".

```
[#] ns-flow-map-implicit-entry(n,c) ::=
    ns-flow-map-yaml-key-entry(n,c)
  | c-ns-flow-map-empty-key-entry(n,c)
  | c-ns-flow-map-json-key-entry(n,c)
```

```
[#] ns-flow-map-yaml-key-entry(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-yaml-node(n,c)
  (
      (
        s-separate(n,c)?
        c-ns-flow-map-separate-value(n,c)
      )
    | e-node    # ""
  )
```

```
[#] c-ns-flow-map-empty-key-entry(n,c) ::=
  e-node    # ""
  c-ns-flow-map-separate-value(n,c)
```

```
[#] c-ns-flow-map-separate-value(n,c) ::=
  c-mapping-value    # ':'
  [lookahead ≠ ns-plain-safe(c)]
  (
      (
        s-separate(n,c)
        ns-flow-node(n,c)
      )
    | e-node    # ""
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Mapping Separate Values**</code>

```
{
unquoted·:·"separate",
https://foo.com,
omitted value:°,
°:·omitted key,
}
```

```
{ "unquoted": "separate",
  "http://foo.com": null,
  "omitted value": null,
  null: "omitted key" }
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-flow-yaml-node(n,c)] &lt;!-- unquoted https://foo.com omitted_value --&gt;
* [e-node] &lt;!-- :·"separate" 4:14,2 :·omitted_key --&gt;
* [c-ns-flow-map-separate-value(n,c)] &lt;!-- 4:15 5:1 --&gt;


To ensure [JSON compatibility], if a [key] inside a flow mapping is
[JSON-like], YAML allows the following [value] to be specified adjacent to the
"**`:`**".
This causes no ambiguity, as all [JSON-like] [keys] are surrounded by
[indicators].
However, as this greatly reduces readability, YAML [processors] should
[separate] the [value] from the "**`:`**" on output, even in this case.

```
[#] c-ns-flow-map-json-key-entry(n,c) ::=
  c-flow-json-node(n,c)
  (
      (
        s-separate(n,c)?
        c-ns-flow-map-adjacent-value(n,c)
      )
    | e-node    # ""
  )
```

```
[#] c-ns-flow-map-adjacent-value(n,c) ::=
  c-mapping-value          # ':'
  (
      (
        s-separate(n,c)?
        ns-flow-node(n,c)
      )
    | e-node    # ""
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Mapping Adjacent Values**</code>

```
{
"adjacent":value,
"readable":·value,
"empty":°
}
```

```
{ "adjacent": "value",
  "readable": "value",
  "empty": null }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-flow-json-node(n,c)] &lt;!-- "adjacent" "readable" "empty" --&gt;
* [e-node] &lt;!-- ° --&gt;
* [c-ns-flow-map-adjacent-value(n,c)] &lt;!-- value --&gt;


A more compact notation is usable inside [flow sequences], if the [mapping]
contains a _single key/value pair_.
This notation does not require the surrounding "**`{`**" and "**`}`**"
characters.
Note that it is not possible to specify any [node properties] for the [mapping]
in this case.


<code>**Example #. Single Pair Flow Mappings**</code>

```
[
foo: bar
]
```

```
[ { "foo": "bar" } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-flow-pair(n,c)] &lt;!-- foo:_bar --&gt;


If the "**`?`**" indicator is explicitly specified, [parsing] is unambiguous
and the syntax is identical to the general case.

```
[#] ns-flow-pair(n,c) ::=
    (
      c-mapping-key      # '?'
      s-separate(n,c)
      ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c)
    )
  | ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c)
```


<code>**Example #. Single Pair Explicit Entry**</code>

```
[
? foo
 bar : baz
]
```

```
[ { "foo bar": "baz" } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c)] &lt;!-- foo bar_:_baz --&gt;


If the "**`?`**" indicator is omitted, [parsing] needs to see past the
_implicit key_ to recognize it as such.
To limit the amount of lookahead required, the "**`:`**" indicator must appear
at most 1024 Unicode characters beyond the start of the [key].
In addition, the [key] is restricted to a single line.

Note that YAML allows arbitrary [nodes] to be used as [keys].
In particular, a [key] may be a [sequence] or a [mapping].
Thus, without the above restrictions, practical one-pass [parsing] would have
been impossible to implement.

```
[#] ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c) ::=
    ns-flow-pair-yaml-key-entry(n,c)
  | c-ns-flow-map-empty-key-entry(n,c)

<code>## #. Flow Nodes</code>

_JSON-like_ [flow styles] all have explicit start and end [indicators].
The only [flow style] that does not have this property is the [plain scalar].
Note that none of the "JSON-like" styles is actually acceptable by JSON.
Even the [double-quoted style] is a superset of the JSON string format.

```
[#] ns-flow-yaml-content(n,c) ::=
  ns-plain(n,c)
```

```
[#] c-flow-json-content(n,c) ::=
    c-flow-sequence(n,c)
  | c-flow-mapping(n,c)
  | c-single-quoted(n,c)

```

```
[#] ns-flow-content(n,c) ::=
    ns-flow-yaml-content(n,c)
  | c-flow-json-content(n,c)
```


<code>**Example #. Flow Content**</code>

```

A complete [flow] [node] also has optional [node properties], except for [alias
nodes] which refer to the [anchored] [node properties].

```

<code># Chapter #. Block Styles</code>

YAML's _block styles_ employ [indentation] rather than [indicators] to denote
structure.
This results in a more human readable (though less compact) notation.


<code>## #. Block Scalar Styles</code>

YAML provides two _block scalar styles_, [literal] and [folded].
Each provides a different trade-off between readability and expressive power.


<code>### #. Block Scalar Headers</code>

[Block scalars] are controlled by a few [indicators] given in a _header_
preceding the [content] itself.
This header is followed by a non-content [line break] with an optional
[comment].
This is the only case where a [comment] must not be followed by additional
[comment] lines.

&gt; Note: See [Production Parameters] for the definition of the `t` variable.

```
[#] c-b-block-header(t) ::=
  (
      (
        c-indentation-indicator
        c-chomping-indicator(t)
      )
    | (
        c-chomping-indicator(t)
        c-indentation-indicator
      )
  )
  s-b-comment
```


<code>**Example #. Block Scalar Header**</code>

```
- | # Empty header↓

**Legend:**
* [c-b-block-header(t)] &lt;!-- _#_Empty_header↓ 01_#_Indentation_indicator↓ +_#_Chomping_indicator↓ 01-_#_Both_indicators↓ --&gt;


<code>#### #. Block Indentation Indicator</code>

Every block scalar has a _content indentation level_.
The content of the block scalar excludes a number of leading [spaces] on each
line equal to the content indentation level.

If a block scalar has an _indentation indicator_, then the content indentation
level of the block scalar is equal to the indentation level of the block scalar
plus the value of the indentation indicator.

If no indentation indicator is given, then the content indentation level is
equal to the number of leading [spaces] on the first non-[empty line] of the
contents.

A block scalar may have an _indentation indicator_, which is a single decimal
digit indicating the indentation level of the content.

It is an error for any of the leading [empty lines] to contain more [spaces]
than the first non-[empty line].

A YAML [processor] should only emit an explicit indentation indicator for cases
where detection will fail.

```
[#] c-indentation-indicator ::=
  ns-dec-digit
```


<code>**Example #. Block Indentation Indicator**</code>

```
- |°
·detected
- &gt;°
·
··
··# detected
- |1
··explicit
- &gt;°
·→
·detected
```

```
[ "detected\n",

  "\t\ndetected\n" ]
```

**Legend:**
* [c-indentation-indicator] &lt;!-- ° 7:4 --&gt;

<code>**Example #. Invalid Block Scalar Indentation Indicators**</code>

```
ERROR:

  not have too many spaces.

  than the indicated level.
```
&lt;!-- spaces --&gt;
&lt;!-- 5:10,13 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 6:15,13 --&gt;


<code>#### #. Block Chomping Indicator</code>

_Chomping_ controls how final [line breaks] and trailing [empty lines] are
interpreted.
YAML provides three chomping methods:


? Strip

: _Stripping_ is specified by the _"**`-`**" chomping indicator_.
In this case, the final [line break] and any trailing [empty lines] are
excluded from the [scalar's content].


? Clip

: _Clipping_ is the default behavior used if no explicit chomping indicator is
specified.
In this case, the final [line break] character is preserved in the [scalar's
content].
However, any trailing [empty lines] are excluded from the [scalar's content].


? Keep

: _Keeping_ is specified by the _"**`+`**" chomping indicator_.
In this case, the final [line break] and any trailing [empty lines] are
considered to be part of the [scalar's content].
These additional lines are not subject to [folding].

The chomping method used is a [presentation detail] and must not be used to
convey [content] information.

```
[#] c-chomping-indicator(STRIP) ::= '-'
    c-chomping-indicator(KEEP)  ::= '+'
    c-chomping-indicator(CLIP)  ::= ""
```


The interpretation of the final [line break] of a [block scalar] is controlled
by the chomping indicator specified in the [block scalar header].

```
[#] b-chomped-last(t) ::=
    b-chomped-last(STRIP) ::= b-non-content  | &lt;end of input&gt;
    b-chomped-last(CLIP)  ::= b-as-line-feed | &lt;end of input&gt;
    b-chomped-last(KEEP)  ::= b-as-line-feed | &lt;end of input&gt;
```


<code>**Example #. Chomping Final Line Break**</code>

```
strip: |-
  text↓
clip: |
  text↓
keep: |+
  text↓
```

```
{ "strip": "text",
  "clip": "text\n",
  "keep": "text\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [b-non-content] &lt;!-- 2:7 --&gt;
* [b-as-line-feed] &lt;!-- 4:7 6:7 --&gt;


The interpretation of the trailing [empty lines] following a [block scalar] is
also controlled by the chomping indicator specified in the [block scalar
header].

```
[#] l-chomped-empty(n,STRIP) ::= l-strip-empty(n)
    l-chomped-empty(n,CLIP)  ::= l-strip-empty(n)
    l-chomped-empty(n,KEEP)  ::= l-keep-empty(n)
```

```
[#] l-strip-empty(n) ::=
  (
    s-indent-less-or-equal(n)
    b-non-content
  )*
  l-trail-comments(n)?
```

```
[#] l-keep-empty(n) ::=
  l-empty(n,BLOCK-IN)*
  l-trail-comments(n)?
```


Explicit [comment] lines may follow the trailing [empty lines].
To prevent ambiguity, the first such [comment] line must be less [indented]
than the [block scalar content].
Additional [comment] lines, if any, are not so restricted.
This is the only case where the [indentation] of [comment] lines is
constrained.

```
[#] l-trail-comments(n) ::=
  s-indent-less-than(n)
  c-nb-comment-text
  b-comment
  l-comment*
```


<code>**Example #. Chomping Trailing Lines**</code>

```
<code># Strip</code>
  # Comments:
strip: |-
  # text↓
··⇓
·# Clip
··# comments:
↓
clip: |
  # text↓
·↓
·# Keep
··# comments:
↓
keep: |+
  # text↓
↓
·# Trail
··# comments.
```

```
{ "strip": "# text",
  "clip": "# text\n",
  "keep": "# text\n\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [l-strip-empty(n)] &lt;!-- 5 6 7 8 11 12 13 14 --&gt;
* [l-keep-empty(n)] &lt;!-- 17 18 19 --&gt;
* [l-trail-comments(n)] &lt;!-- 6 7 8 12 13 14 18 19 --&gt;

If a [block scalar] consists only of [empty lines], then these lines are
considered as trailing lines and hence are affected by chomping.


<code>**Example #. Empty Scalar Chomping**</code>

```
strip: &gt;-
↓
clip: &gt;
↓
keep: |+
↓
```

```
{ "strip": "",
  "clip": "",
  "keep": "\n" }
```

**Legend:**
* [l-strip-empty(n)] &lt;!-- 2 4 --&gt;
* [l-keep-empty(n)] &lt;!-- 6 --&gt;


<code>### #. Literal Style</code>

The _literal style_ is denoted by the _"**`|`**" indicator_.
It is the simplest, most restricted and most readable [scalar style].

```
[#] c-l+literal(n) ::=
  c-literal                # '|'
  c-b-block-header(t)
  l-literal-content(n+m,t)
```


<code>**Example #. Literal Scalar**</code>

```
|↓
·literal↓
·→text↓
↓
```

```
"literal\n\ttext\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-l+literal(n)] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 4 --&gt;


Inside literal scalars, all ([indented]) characters are considered to be
[content], including [white space] characters.
Note that all [line break] characters are [normalized].
In addition, [empty lines] are not [folded], though final [line breaks] and
trailing [empty lines] are [chomped].

There is no way to escape characters inside literal scalars.
This restricts them to [printable] characters.
In addition, there is no way to break a long literal line.

```
[#] l-nb-literal-text(n) ::=
  l-empty(n,BLOCK-IN)*
  s-indent(n) nb-char+
```

```
[#] b-nb-literal-next(n) ::=
  b-as-line-feed
  l-nb-literal-text(n)
```

```
[#] l-literal-content(n,t) ::=
  (
    l-nb-literal-text(n)
    b-nb-literal-next(n)*
    b-chomped-last(t)
  )?
  l-chomped-empty(n,t)
```


<code>**Example #. Literal Content**</code>

```
|
·
··
··literal↓
···↓
··
··text↓
↓
·# Comment
```

```
"\n\nliteral\n·\n\ntext\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [l-nb-literal-text(n)] &lt;!-- 2 3 4:1,9 5:1,3 6 7:1,6 --&gt;
* [b-nb-literal-next(n)] &lt;!-- 4:10 5:1,3 5:4 6 7:1,6 --&gt;
* [b-chomped-last(t)] &lt;!-- 7:7 --&gt;
* [l-chomped-empty(n,t)] &lt;!-- 9 --&gt;


<code>### #. Folded Style</code>

The _folded style_ is denoted by the _"**`&gt;`**" indicator_.
It is similar to the [literal style]; however, folded scalars are subject to
[line folding].

```
[#] c-l+folded(n) ::=
  c-folded                 # '&gt;'
  c-b-block-header(t)
  l-folded-content(n+m,t)
```


<code>**Example #. Folded Scalar**</code>

```
&gt;↓
·folded↓
·text↓
↓
```

```
"folded text\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-l+folded(n)] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 4 --&gt;


[Folding] allows long lines to be broken anywhere a single [space] character
separates two non-[space] characters.

```
[#] s-nb-folded-text(n) ::=
  s-indent(n)
  ns-char
  nb-char*
```

```
[#] l-nb-folded-lines(n) ::=
  s-nb-folded-text(n)
  (
    b-l-folded(n,BLOCK-IN)
    s-nb-folded-text(n)
  )*
```


<code>**Example #. Folded Lines**</code>

```
&gt;

·folded↓
·line↓
↓
·next
·line↓
   * bullet

   * list
   * lines

·last↓
·line↓

<code># Comment</code>
```

```
"\nfolded line\nnext line\n  \
* bullet\n \n  * list\n  \
* lines\n\nlast line\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [l-nb-folded-lines(n)] &lt;!-- 3:1,7 4:1,5 6 7:1,5 13:1,5 14:1,5 --&gt;
* [s-nb-folded-text(n)] &lt;!-- 3 4 6 7:1,5 13 14:1,5 --&gt;


(The following three examples duplicate this example, each highlighting
different productions.)

Lines starting with [white space] characters (_more-indented_ lines) are not
[folded].

```
[#] s-nb-spaced-text(n) ::=
  s-indent(n)
  s-white
  nb-char*
```

```
[#] b-l-spaced(n) ::=
  b-as-line-feed
  l-empty(n,BLOCK-IN)*
```

```

* [s-nb-spaced-text(n)] &lt;!-- 8:1,11 10:1,9 11:1,10 --&gt;


[Line breaks] and [empty lines] separating folded and more-indented lines are
also not [folded].

```
[#] l-nb-same-lines(n) ::=
  l-empty(n,BLOCK-IN)*
  (
      l-nb-folded-lines(n)

* (separation) [l-empty(n,c)] &lt;!-- 2 5 12 --&gt;


The final [line break] and trailing [empty lines] if any, are subject to
[chomping] and are never [folded].

```
[#] l-folded-content(n,t) ::=
  (
    l-nb-diff-lines(n)
    b-chomped-last(t)
  )?
  l-chomped-empty(n,t)
```

```

**Legend:**
* [b-chomped-last(t)] &lt;!-- 14:6 --&gt;
* [l-chomped-empty(n,t)] &lt;!-- 15 16 --&gt;


<code>## #. Block Collection Styles</code>

For readability, _block collections styles_ are not denoted by any [indicator].
Instead, YAML uses a lookahead method, where a block collection is
distinguished from a [plain scalar] only when a [key/value pair] or a [sequence
entry] is seen.


<code>### #. Block Sequences</code>

A _block sequence_ is simply a series of [nodes], each denoted by a leading
_"**`-`**" indicator_.
The "**`-`**" indicator must be [separated] from the [node] by [white space].
This allows "**`-`**" to be used as the first character in a [plain scalar] if
followed by a non-space character (e.g. "**`-42`**").

```
[#] l+block-sequence(n) ::=
  (
    s-indent(n+1+m)
    c-l-block-seq-entry(n+1+m)
  )+
```

```
[#] c-l-block-seq-entry(n) ::=
  c-sequence-entry    # '-'
  [lookahead ≠ ns-char]
  s-l+block-indented(n,BLOCK-IN)
```


<code>**Example #. Block Sequence**</code>

```
block sequence:
··- one↓
  - two : three↓
```

```
{ "block sequence": [
    "one",
    { "two": "three" } ] }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-l-block-seq-entry(n)] &lt;!-- 2:3, 3:3, --&gt;
* auto-detected [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 2:1,2 --&gt;


The entry [node] may be either [completely empty], be a nested [block node] or
use a _compact in-line notation_.
The compact notation may be used when the entry is itself a nested [block
collection].
In this case, both the "**`-`**" indicator and the following [spaces] are
considered to be part of the [indentation] of the nested [collection].
Note that it is not possible to specify [node properties] for such a
[collection].

```
[#] s-l+block-indented(n,c) ::=
    (
      s-indent(m)
      (
          ns-l-compact-sequence(n+1+m)
        | ns-l-compact-mapping(n+1+m)
      )
    )
  | s-l+block-node(n,c)
  | (
      e-node    # ""
      s-l-comments
    )
```

```
[#] ns-l-compact-sequence(n) ::=

```


<code>**Example #. Block Sequence Entry Types**</code>

* [ns-l-compact-mapping(n)] &lt;!-- _one:_two_#_Compact_mapping --&gt;


<code>### #. Block Mappings</code>

A _Block mapping_ is a series of entries, each [presenting] a [key/value pair].

```
[#] l+block-mapping(n) ::=
  (
    s-indent(n+1+m)
    ns-l-block-map-entry(n+1+m)
  )+
```


<code>**Example #. Block Mappings**</code>

```
block mapping:

```

**Legend:**
* [ns-l-block-map-entry(n)] &lt;!-- 2:2, --&gt;
* auto-detected [s-indent(n)] &lt;!-- 2:1 --&gt;


If the ["**`?`**"] indicator is specified, the optional value node must be
specified on a separate line, denoted by the ["**`:`**"] indicator.
Note that YAML allows here the same [compact in-line notation] described above
for [block sequence] entries.

```
[#] ns-l-block-map-entry(n) ::=
    c-l-block-map-explicit-entry(n)
  | ns-l-block-map-implicit-entry(n)
```

```
[#] c-l-block-map-explicit-entry(n) ::=

  block key↓
:·- one # Explicit compact
··- two # block value↓
```

```
{ "explicit key": null,
  "block key\n": [
    "one",
    "two" ] }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-l-block-map-explicit-key(n)] &lt;!-- 1:1,29 2 3 --&gt;
* [l-block-map-explicit-value(n)] &lt;!-- 4 5 --&gt;
* [e-node] &lt;!-- 1:30 --&gt;

&lt;!-- REVIEW value should be null above --&gt;

If the "**`?`**" indicator is omitted, [parsing] needs to see past the
[implicit key], in the same way as in the [single key/value pair] [flow
mapping].
Hence, such [keys] are subject to the same restrictions; they are limited to a
single line and must not span more than 1024 Unicode characters.

```
[#] ns-l-block-map-implicit-entry(n) ::=
  (
      ns-s-block-map-implicit-key
    | e-node    # ""
  )
  c-l-block-map-implicit-value(n)
```

```
[#] ns-s-block-map-implicit-key ::=
    c-s-implicit-json-key(BLOCK-KEY)
  | ns-s-implicit-yaml-key(BLOCK-KEY)
```


In this case, the [value] may be specified on the same line as the [implicit
key].
Note however that in block mappings the [value] must never be adjacent to the
"**`:`**", as this greatly reduces readability and is not required for [JSON
compatibility] (unlike the case in [flow mappings]).

There is no compact notation for in-line [values].
Also, while both the [implicit key] and the [value] following it may be empty,
the ["**`:`**"] indicator is mandatory.
This prevents a potential ambiguity with multi-line [plain scalars].

```
[#] c-l-block-map-implicit-value(n) ::=
  c-mapping-value                  # ':'
  (
      s-l+block-node(n,BLOCK-OUT)
    | (
        e-node    # ""
        s-l-comments
      )
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Implicit Block Mapping Entries**</code>

```
plain key: in-line value
°:° # Both empty
"quoted key":
- entry
```

```
{ "plain key": "in-line value",
  null: null,
  "quoted key": [ "entry" ] }
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-s-block-map-implicit-key] &lt;!-- 1:1,9 2:1 3:1,12 --&gt;
* [c-l-block-map-implicit-value(n)] &lt;!-- 1:10, 2:2, 3:13 4 --&gt;


A [compact in-line notation] is also available.
This compact notation may be nested inside [block sequences] and explicit block
mapping entries.
Note that it is not possible to specify [node properties] for such a nested
mapping.

```
[#] ns-l-compact-mapping(n) ::=
  ns-l-block-map-entry(n)
  (
    s-indent(n)
    ns-l-block-map-entry(n)
  )*
```


<code>**Example #. Compact Block Mappings**</code>

```
- sun: yellow↓
- ? earth: blue↓
  : moon: white↓
```

```
[ { "sun": "yellow" },
  { { "earth": "blue" }:
      { "moon": "white" } } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [ns-l-compact-mapping(n)] &lt;!-- 1:3, 2:3, 3 --&gt;


<code>### #. Block Nodes</code>

YAML allows [flow nodes] to be embedded inside [block collections] (but not
vice-versa).
[Flow nodes] must be [indented] by at least one more [space] than the parent
[block collection].
Note that [flow nodes] may begin on a following line.

It is at this point that [parsing] needs to distinguish between a [plain
scalar] and an [implicit key] starting a nested [block mapping].

```
[#] s-l+block-node(n,c) ::=
    s-l+block-in-block(n,c)
  | s-l+flow-in-block(n)
```

```
[#] s-l+flow-in-block(n) ::=
  s-separate(n+1,FLOW-OUT)
  ns-flow-node(n+1,FLOW-OUT)
  s-l-comments
```


<code>**Example #. Block Node Types**</code>

```
-↓
··"flow in block"↓
-·&gt;
 Block scalar↓
-·!!map # Block collection
  foo : bar↓
```

```
[ "flow in block",
  "Block scalar\n",
  { "foo": "bar" } ]
```

**Legend:**
* [s-l+flow-in-block(n)] &lt;!-- 1:2 2 --&gt;
* [s-l+block-in-block(n,c)] &lt;!-- 3:3 4 5:3, 6 --&gt;


The block [node's properties] may span across several lines.
In this case, they must be [indented] by at least one more [space] than the
[block collection], regardless of the [indentation] of the [block collection]
entries.

```
[#] s-l+block-in-block(n,c) ::=
    s-l+block-scalar(n,c)
  | s-l+block-collection(n,c)
```

```
[#] s-l+block-scalar(n,c) ::=
  s-separate(n+1,c)
  (
    c-ns-properties(n+1,c)
    s-separate(n+1,c)
  )?
  (
      c-l+literal(n)
    | c-l+folded(n)
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Block Scalar Nodes**</code>

```
literal: |2
··value
folded:↓
···!foo
··&gt;1
·value
```

```
{ "literal": "value",
  "folded": !&lt;!foo&gt; "value" }
```

**Legend:**
* [c-l+literal(n)] &lt;!-- 1:10, 2:1,7 --&gt;
* [c-l+folded(n)] &lt;!-- 3:8 4 5 6 --&gt;


Since people perceive the ["**`-`**" indicator] as [indentation], nested [block
sequences] may be [indented] by one less [space] to compensate, except, of
course, if nested inside another [block sequence] ([**`BLOCK-OUT`** context]
versus [**`BLOCK-IN`** context]).

```
[#] s-l+block-collection(n,c) ::=
  (
    s-separate(n+1,c)
    c-ns-properties(n+1,c)
  )?
  s-l-comments
  (
      seq-space(n,c)
    | l+block-mapping(n)
  )
```

```
[#] seq-space(n,BLOCK-OUT) ::= l+block-sequence(n-1)
    seq-space(n,BLOCK-IN)  ::= l+block-sequence(n)
```


<code>**Example #. Block Collection Nodes**</code>

```
sequence: !!seq
- entry
- !!seq
 - nested
mapping: !!map
 foo: bar
```

```
{ "sequence": [
    "entry",
    [ "nested" ] ],
  "mapping": { "foo": "bar" } }
```

**Legend:**
* [s-l+block-collection(n,c)] &lt;!-- 1:10, 2 3 4 5:9, 6 --&gt;
* [l+block-sequence(n)] &lt;!-- 2 3 4 --&gt;
* [l+block-mapping(n)] &lt;!-- 6 --&gt;


<code># Chapter #. YAML Character Stream</code>

<code>## #. Documents</code>

A YAML character [stream] may contain several _documents_.
Each document is completely independent from the rest.


<code>### #. Document Prefix</code>

A document may be preceded by a _prefix_ specifying the [character encoding]
and optional [comment] lines.
Note that all [documents] in a stream must use the same [character encoding].
However it is valid to re-specify the [encoding] using a [byte order mark] for
each [document] in the stream.

The existence of the optional prefix does not necessarily indicate the
existence of an actual [document].

```
[#] l-document-prefix ::=
  c-byte-order-mark?
  l-comment*
```


<code>**Example #. Document Prefix**</code>

```
⇔# Comment
<code># lines</code>
Document
```

```
"Document"
```

**Legend:**
* [l-document-prefix] &lt;!-- 1 2 --&gt;


<code>### #. Document Markers</code>

Using [directives] creates a potential ambiguity.
It is valid to have a ["**`%`**"] character at the start of a line (e.g. as the
first character of the second line of a [plain scalar]).
How, then, to distinguish between an actual [directive] and a [content] line
that happens to start with a ["**`%`**"] character?

The solution is the use of two special _marker_ lines to control the processing
of [directives], one at the start of a [document] and one at the end.

At the start of a [document], lines beginning with a ["**`%`**"] character are
assumed to be [directives].
The (possibly empty) list of [directives] is terminated by a _directives end
marker_ line.
Lines following this marker can safely use ["**`%`**"] as the first character.

At the end of a [document], a _document end marker_ line is used to signal the
[parser] to begin scanning for [directives] again.

The existence of this optional _document suffix_ does not necessarily indicate
the existence of an actual following [document].

Obviously, the actual [content] lines are therefore forbidden to begin with
either of these markers.

```
[#] c-directives-end ::= "---"
```

```
[#] c-document-end ::= "..."
```

```
[#] l-document-suffix ::=
  c-document-end
  s-l-comments
```

```
[#] c-forbidden ::=
  &lt;start of line&gt;
  (
      c-directives-end
    | c-document-end
  )
  (
      b-char
    | s-white
    | &lt;end of input&gt;
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Document Markers**</code>

```
%YAML 1.2
---
Document
... # Suffix
```

```
"Document"
```

**Legend:**
* [c-directives-end] &lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
* [l-document-suffix] &lt;!-- 4 --&gt;
* [c-document-end] &lt;!-- 4:1,3 --&gt;


<code>### #. Bare Documents</code>

A _bare document_ does not begin with any [directives] or [marker] lines.
Such documents are very "clean" as they contain nothing other than the
[content].
In this case, the first non-comment line may not start with a ["**`%`**"] first
character.

Document [nodes] are [indented] as if they have a parent [indented] at -1
[spaces].
Since a [node] must be more [indented] than its parent [node], this allows the
document's [node] to be [indented] at zero or more [spaces].

```
[#] l-bare-document ::=
  s-l+block-node(-1,BLOCK-IN)
  /* Excluding c-forbidden content */
```


<code>**Example #. Bare Documents**</code>

```
Bare
document
...
<code># No document</code>
...
|
%!PS-Adobe-2.0 # Not the first line
```

```
"Bare document"
---
"%!PS-Adobe-2.0\n"
```

**Legend:**
* [l-bare-document] &lt;!-- 1 2 6 7 --&gt;


<code>### #. Explicit Documents</code>

An _explicit document_ begins with an explicit [directives end marker] line but
no [directives].
Since the existence of the [document] is indicated by this [marker], the
[document] itself may be [completely empty].

```
[#] l-explicit-document ::=
  c-directives-end
  (
      l-bare-document
    | (
        e-node    # ""
        s-l-comments
      )
  )
```


<code>**Example #. Explicit Documents**</code>

```
---
{ matches
% : 20 }
...
---
<code># Empty</code>
...
```

```
{ "matches %": 20 }
---
null
```

**Legend:**
* [l-explicit-document] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 5 6 --&gt;


<code>### #. Directives Documents</code>

A _directives document_ begins with some [directives] followed by an explicit
[directives end marker] line.

```
[#] l-directive-document ::=
  l-directive+
  l-explicit-document
```


<code>**Example #. Directives Documents**</code>

```
%YAML 1.2
--- |
%!PS-Adobe-2.0
...
%YAML 1.2
---
<code># Empty</code>
...
```

```
"%!PS-Adobe-2.0\n"
---
null
```

**Legend:**
* [l-explicit-document] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 5 6 7 --&gt;


<code>## #. Streams</code>

A YAML _stream_ consists of zero or more [documents].
Subsequent [documents] require some sort of separation [marker] line.
If a [document] is not terminated by a [document end marker] line, then the
following [document] must begin with a [directives end marker] line.

```
[#] l-any-document ::=
    l-directive-document
  | l-explicit-document
  | l-bare-document
```

```
[#] l-yaml-stream ::=
  l-document-prefix*
  l-any-document?
  (
      (
        l-document-suffix+
        l-document-prefix*
        l-any-document?
      )
    | (
        l-document-prefix*
        l-explicit-document?
      )
  )*
```


<code>**Example #. Stream**</code>

```
Document
---
<code># Empty</code>
...
%YAML 1.2
---
matches %: 20
```

```
"Document"
---
null
---
{ "matches %": 20 }
```

**Legend:**
* [l-any-document] &lt;!-- 1 2 3 --&gt;
* [l-document-suffix] &lt;!-- 4 --&gt;
* [l-explicit-document] &lt;!-- 5 6 7 --&gt;


A sequence of bytes is a _well-formed stream_ if, taken as a whole, it complies
with the above **`l-yaml-stream`** production.

Some common use case that can take advantage of the YAML stream structure are:


? Appending to Streams

: Allowing multiple [documents] in a single stream makes YAML suitable for log
files and similar [applications].
Note that each [document] is independent of the rest, allowing for
heterogeneous log file entries.


? Concatenating Streams

: Concatenating two YAML streams requires both to use the same [character
encoding].
In addition, it is necessary to separate the last [document] of the first
stream and the first [document] of the second stream.
This is easily ensured by inserting a [document end marker] between the two
streams.


? Communication Streams

: The [document end marker] allows signaling the end of a [document] without
closing the stream or starting the next [document].
This allows the receiver to complete processing a [document] without having to
wait for the next one to arrive.
The sender may also transmit "keep-alive" messages in the form of [comment]
lines or repeated [document end markers] without signaling the start of the
next [document].


<code># Chapter #. Recommended Schemas</code>

A YAML _schema_ is a combination of a set of [tags] and a mechanism for
[resolving] [non-specific tags].


<code>## #. Failsafe Schema</code>

The _failsafe schema_ is guaranteed to work with any YAML [document].
It is therefore the recommended [schema] for generic YAML tools.
A YAML [processor] should therefore support this [schema], at least as an
option.


<code>### #. Tags</code>

<code>#### #. Generic Mapping</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**


? Kind

: [Mapping].


? Definition

: [Represents] an associative container, where each [key] is unique in the
association and mapped to exactly one [value].
YAML places no restrictions on the type of [keys]; in particular, they are not
restricted to being [scalars].
Example [bindings] to [native] types include Perl's hash, Python's dictionary
and Java's Hashtable.


<code>**Example #. `!!map` Examples**</code>

```
Block style: !!map
  Clark : Evans
  Ingy  : döt Net
  Oren  : Ben-Kiki

Flow style: !!map { Clark: Evans, Ingy: döt Net, Oren: Ben-Kiki }
```


<code>#### #. Generic Sequence</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**


? Kind

: [Sequence].


? Definition

: [Represents] a collection indexed by sequential integers starting with zero.
Example [bindings] to [native] types include Perl's array, Python's list or
tuple and Java's array or Vector.


<code>**Example #. `!!seq` Examples**</code>

```
Block style: !!seq
- Clark Evans
- Ingy döt Net
- Oren Ben-Kiki

Flow style: !!seq [ Clark Evans, Ingy döt Net, Oren Ben-Kiki ]
```


<code>#### #. Generic String</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**


? Kind

: [Scalar].


? Definition

: [Represents] a Unicode string, a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters.
This type is usually [bound] to the [native] language's string type or, for
languages lacking one (such as C), to a character array.


? Canonical Form:

: The obvious.


<code>**Example #. `!!str` Examples**</code>

```
Block style: !!str |-
  String: just a theory.

Flow style: !!str "String: just a theory."
```


<code>### #. Tag Resolution</code>

All [nodes] with the ["**`!`**" non-specific tag] are [resolved], by the
standard [convention], to "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**",
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" or "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**", according to
their [kind].

All [nodes] with the ["**`?`**" non-specific tag] are left [unresolved].
This constrains the [application] to deal with a [partial representation].


<code>## #. JSON Schema</code>

The _JSON schema_ is the lowest common denominator of most modern computer
languages and allows [parsing] JSON files.
A YAML [processor] should therefore support this [schema], at least as an
option.
It is also strongly recommended that other [schemas] should be based on it.


<code>### #. Tags</code>

The JSON [schema] uses the following [tags] in addition to those defined by the
[failsafe] schema:


<code>#### #. Null</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:null`**


? Kind

: [Scalar].


? Definition

: [Represents] the lack of a value.
This is typically [bound] to a [native] null-like value (e.g., **`undef`** in
Perl, **`None`** in Python).
Note that a null is different from an empty string.
Also, a [mapping] entry with some [key] and a null [value] is valid and
different from not having that [key] in the [mapping].


? Canonical Form

: **`null`**.

<code>**Example #. `!!null` Examples**</code>

```
!!null null: value for null key
key with null value: !!null null
```


<code>#### #. Boolean</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:bool`**


? Kind

: [Scalar].


? Definition

: [Represents] a true/false value.
In languages without a [native] Boolean type (such as C), they are usually
[bound] to a native integer type, using one for true and zero for false.


? Canonical Form

: Either **`true`** or **`false`**.


<code>**Example #. `!!bool` Examples**</code>

```
YAML is a superset of JSON: !!bool true
Pluto is a planet: !!bool false
```


<code>#### #. Integer</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:int`**


? Kind

: [Scalar].


? Definition

: [Represents] arbitrary sized finite mathematical integers.
Scalars of this type should be [bound] to a [native] integer data type, if
possible.

: Some languages (such as Perl) provide only a "number" type that allows for
both integer and floating-point values.
A YAML [processor] may use such a type for integers as long as they round-trip
properly.

: In some languages (such as C), an integer may overflow the [native] type's
storage capability.
A YAML [processor] may reject such a value as an error, truncate it with a
warning or find some other manner to round-trip it.
In general, integers representable using 32 binary digits should safely
round-trip through most systems.


? Canonical Form

: Decimal integer notation, with a leading "**`-`**" character for negative
values, matching the regular expression **`0 | -? [1-9] [0-9]*`**


<code>**Example #. `!!int` Examples**</code>

```
negative: !!int -12
zero: !!int 0
positive: !!int 34
```


<code>#### #. Floating Point</code>

? URI

: **`tag:yaml.org,2002:float`**


? Kind

: [Scalar].


? Definition

: [Represents] an approximation to real numbers, including three special values
(positive and negative infinity and "not a number").

: Some languages (such as Perl) provide only a "number" type that allows for
both integer and floating-point values.
A YAML [processor] may use such a type for floating-point numbers, as long as
they round-trip properly.

: Not all floating-point values can be stored exactly in any given [native]
type.
Hence a float value may change by "a small amount" when round-tripped.
The supported range and accuracy depends on the implementation, though 32 bit
IEEE floats should be safe.
Since YAML does not specify a particular accuracy, using floating-point
[mapping keys] requires great care and is not recommended.


? Canonical Form

: Either **`0`**, **`.inf`**, **`-.inf`**, **`.nan`** or scientific notation
matching the regular expression  
**`-? [1-9] ( \. [0-9]* [1-9] )? ( e [-+] [1-9] [0-9]* )?`**.


<code>**Example #. `!!float` Examples**</code>

```
negative: !!float -1
zero: !!float 0
positive: !!float 2.3e4
infinity: !!float .inf
not a number: !!float .nan
```


<code>### #. Tag Resolution</code>

The [JSON schema] [tag resolution] is an extension of the [failsafe schema]
[tag resolution].

All [nodes] with the ["**`!`**" non-specific tag] are [resolved], by the
standard [convention], to "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**",
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" or "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**", according to
their [kind].

[Collections] with the ["**`?`**" non-specific tag] (that is, [untagged]
[collections]) are [resolved] to "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**" or
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" according to their [kind].

[Scalars] with the ["**`?`**" non-specific tag] (that is, [plain scalars]) are
matched with a list of regular expressions (first match wins, e.g. **`0`** is
resolved as **`!!int`**).
In principle, JSON files should not contain any [scalars] that do not match at
least one of these.
Hence the YAML [processor] should consider them to be an error.


| Regular expression        | Resolved to tag
| --                        | --
| `null`                    | tag:yaml.org,2002:null
| `true | false`            | tag:yaml.org,2002:bool
| `-? ( 0 | [1-9] [0-9]* )` | tag:yaml.org,2002:int
| `-? ( 0 | [1-9] [0-9]* ) ( \. [0-9]* )? ( [eE] [-+]? [0-9]+ )?` | tag:yaml.org,2002:float
| `*`                       | Error

&gt; Note: The regular expression for `float` does not exactly match the one in
the JSON specification, where at least one digit is required after the dot: `(
\.  [0-9]+ )`.  The YAML 1.2 specification intended to match JSON behavior, but
this cannot be addressed in the 1.2.2 specification.

<code>**Example #. JSON Tag Resolution**</code>

```
A null: null
Booleans: [ true, false ]
Integers: [ 0, -0, 3, -19 ]
Floats: [ 0., -0.0, 12e03, -2E+05 ]
Invalid: [ True, Null,
  0o7, 0x3A, +12.3 ]
```

```
{ "A null": null,
  "Booleans": [ true, false ],
  "Integers": [ 0, 0, 3, -19 ],
  "Floats": [ 0.0, -0.0, 12000, -200000 ],
  "Invalid": [ "True", "Null",
    "0o7", "0x3A", "+12.3" ] }
```


<code>## #. Core Schema</code>

The _Core schema_ is an extension of the [JSON schema], allowing for more
human-readable [presentation] of the same types.
This is the recommended default [schema] that YAML [processor] should use
unless instructed otherwise.
It is also strongly recommended that other [schemas] should be based on it.


<code>### #. Tags</code>

The core [schema] uses the same [tags] as the [JSON schema].


<code>### #. Tag Resolution</code>

The [core schema] [tag resolution] is an extension of the [JSON schema] [tag
resolution].

All [nodes] with the ["**`!`**" non-specific tag] are [resolved], by the
standard [convention], to "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**",
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" or "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**", according to
their [kind].

[Collections] with the ["**`?`**" non-specific tag] (that is, [untagged]
[collections]) are [resolved] to "**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**" or
"**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**" according to their [kind].

[Scalars] with the ["**`?`**" non-specific tag] (that is, [plain scalars]) are
matched with an extended list of regular expressions.
However, in this case, if none of the regular expressions matches, the [scalar]
is [resolved] to **`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`** (that is, considered to be a
string).


| Regular expression                | Resolved to tag
| --                                | --
| `null | Null | NULL | ~`          | tag:yaml.org,2002:null
| `/* Empty */`                     | tag:yaml.org,2002:null

<code>**Example #. Core Tag Resolution**</code>

```
A null: null
Also a null: # Empty
Not a null: ""
Booleans: [ true, True, false, FALSE ]
Integers: [ 0, 0o7, 0x3A, -19 ]
Floats: [
  0., -0.0, .5, +12e03, -2E+05 ]
Also floats: [
  .inf, -.Inf, +.INF, .NAN ]
```
```
{ "A null": null,
  "Also a null": null,
  "Not a null": "",
  "Booleans": [ true, true, false, false ],
  "Integers": [ 0, 7, 58, -19 ],
  "Floats": [
    0.0, -0.0, 0.5, 12000, -200000 ],
  "Also floats": [
    Infinity, -Infinity, Infinity, NaN ] }

<code>## #. Other Schemas</code>

None of the above recommended [schemas] preclude the use of arbitrary explicit
[tags].
Hence YAML [processors] for a particular programming language typically provide
some form of [local tags] that map directly to the language's [native data
structures] (e.g., **`!ruby/object:Set`**).

While such [local tags] are useful for ad hoc [applications], they do not
suffice for stable, interoperable cross-[application] or cross-platform data
exchange.

Interoperable [schemas] make use of [global tags] (URIs) that [represent] the
same data across different programming languages.
In addition, an interoperable [schema] may provide additional [tag resolution]
rules.
Such rules may provide additional regular expressions, as well as consider the
path to the [node].
This allows interoperable [schemas] to use [untagged] [nodes].

It is strongly recommended that such [schemas] be based on the [core schema]
defined above.
