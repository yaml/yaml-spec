#===============================================================================
#
# This YAML grammar was generated from https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html by:
# https://github.com/yaml/yaml-grammar/tree/master/bin/yaml-grammar-html-to-yaml
#
# This grammar is a YAML file that should be loadable by any decent existing
# YAML loader. It has also been converted to JSON in a file next to this one.
# The YAML file has lots of helpful comments. The JSON (of course) does not.
#
# The purpose of this grammar-as-yaml file is to make the spec clearer and more
# precise to people implementing YAML parsers. The grammar in the YAML 1.2
# specification is difficult to understand and in a few cases ambiguous or
# incorrect.
#
# This grammar mirrors the 1.2 spec faithfully, but tries to express the rules
# in a more concrete and programatic fashion. Some of the rules that are more
# difficult to understand, ambiguous or incorrect, have a comment section
# before them. Each rule definition is preceded by the original YAML 1.2 spec
# rule text, formatted as a comment.
#
# The YAML Reference Parser project ( which can be found at
# https://github.com/yaml/yaml-reference-parser/ ) uses this file to generate
# 100% correct YAML parsers in many programming languages.

#
#   = Syntax Guide =
#
# The following is an explanation of the various EBNF/DSL syntax forms used in
# this grammar. The original YAML 1.2 spec uses an EBNF form that has more than
# a couple oddities. This file tries to make as much sense of them as possible.
# Each rule that introduces a new syntax is preceded by an explanation.
#
# There are 211 rules in the YAML 1.2 spec. This grammar file has 211 sections,
# one for each rule. The overall structure of this file is a big mapping with
# 2 mapping pairs for each grammar rule. Each rule group looks like this:
#
#   :rule-number: rule-name
#   # original-spec-rule-as-a-comment
#
#   rule-name: rule-definition
#
# The first pair is just for indexing the rule (by rule number) back to the 1.2
# spec. The rule definition is the important part. Complex definitions are data
# structures mostly comprised of other rule-names. The simplest rules point to
# single characters. This forms a top-down grammar where the top is the last
# rule, #211.
#
#
#   == Rule Names ==
#
# A rule name consists of groups of lower case characters and numbers separated
# by dashes (`-`).
#
# Each rule name has a 1 or 2 character prefix indicating the rule type.
#
# Example rule names:
#
#   * nb-foo-bar
#   * nb+foo-bar
#   * nb-foo-bar(n)
#   * nb-foo-bar(n,c)
#
#   === Rule Name Prefixes ===
#
# The rule type prefixes are:
#
#   e  -- Empty (matches no characters)
#   c  -- Character (match one single character)
#   b  -- Break (match a single line break character)
#   nb -- Non-break (match a single non-break character)
#   s  -- Space (match a single whitespace character)
#   ns -- Non-space (match a single non-space character)
#   l  -- Line (match a complete line)
#
# And also (where X and Y are each one of the above prefixes):
#
#   X-Y  -- Match starting with an X- match and ending with a Y- match
#   X+   -- Match X where indentation is greater than n
#   X-Y+ -- Match X-Y where indentation is greater than n
#
#
#   == Rules Variables ==
#
# Some rules are defined with variable arguments indicating that they should be
# passed values when being used. There are 4 distinct variables used in the
# YAML 1.2 grammar.
#
#   n -- Current indentation level. An integer indicating the number of spaces.
#
#   m -- Additional indentation level. An integer indicating number of spaces.
#
#   c -- Current context. String that is one of:
#     * "block-in"
#     * "block-out"
#     * "block-key"
#     * "flow-in"
#     * "flow-out"
#     * "flow-key"
#
#   t -- How to treat whitespace after a literal scalar. One of:
#     * "strip"
#     * "clip"
#     * "keep"
#
# Where and how these variables are set is a bit inconsistent. Some are set by
# explicitly in rules that act like function calls. For example, The starting
# values of n (-1) and c ("block-in") are set in rule 207.
#
# The m variable is set explicitly in rules 183 and 187, albeit by an undefined
# special rule called <auto-detect-indent>. In rules like 185 it assumes that m
# is stored as a state/stack variable and has been set somewhere else.
#
# The t variable is set using functional constructs in rule 164, depending on
# the value of a c-chomping-indicator rule.
#
#
#   == Special Rule Names ==
#
# A handful of rule names are words inside angle brackets. These are called
# "special rules". They are not defined in the grammar. Each of these rules is
# an assertion that doesn't consume any text in the parse. They are:
#
#   * <empty>
#     Always matches.
#
#   * <start-of-line>
#     Current parse position is at the start of a line.
#
#   * <end-of-stream>
#     Current parse position is at the end of the input stream.
#
#   * <auto-detect-indent>
#     Detect the number of characters of new indentation.
#
#
#   == Rule Definitions ==
#
# The rule definitions here are expressed as YAML data structures where the
# scalar values can be:
#
#   * A rule name
#   * A literal character (always single quoted for clarity)
#   * Some special DSL forms
#
# The various DSL forms were chosen carefully to be easily read and understood
# by the people reading it. The rest of this section describes those forms.
#
#   === Special Syntax Used ===
#
# There are some syntax conventions used for clarity. Everything is valid YAML.
# Certain things could be expressed in YAML different ways. For instance a
# single character to be matched could be unquoted, single-quoted or
# double-quoted. If the intent is to match a single character, it is single
# quoted.
#
#   * unquoted-word         -- Usually a rule name
#   * unquoted-single-char  -- A variable name
#   * single-quoted-char    -- A character to match
#   * double-quoted-string  -- A literal string value
#   * (...)                 -- A parsing function
#   * <...>                 -- A special rule name
#
#   === Hex Codes ===
#
# Hex codes are scalars beginning with an `x` followed by an even number of
# uppercase hexadecimal digits. Since hex codes represent characters they are
# encoded in single quotes.
#
# There are hex ranges as well, which consist of a pair hex codes.
#
#   === Rule Functions ===
#
# The grammar uses these functions. The function name is always in parentheses.
# The name is a key of a single pair mapping.
#
#   * (any)
#     One of the rules in the group must match.
#
#   * (all)
#     All of the rules in the group must match.
#
#   * (+++)
#     The rule must match 1 or more times.
#
#   * (***)
#     The rule must match 0 or more times.
#
#   * (???)
#     The rule must match 0 or 1 times.
#
#   * ({x})
#     The rule must match x times, where x is an integer or a variable.
#
#   * (===)
#     Positive look-ahead assertion.
#
#   * (!==)
#     Negative look-ahead assertion.
#
#   * (<==)
#     Positive look-behind assertion.
#
#   * (---)
#     A set of characters comprised of the first set minus each of the others.
#
#   * (...)
#     The argument variables that are passed to this rule. Either a single
#     value or a sequence of values.
#
#   * (case)
#     A variable indicated by `var` must match one of the other keys. The value
#     of the matching key pair is the next rule to be checked.
#
#   * (flip)
#     Some grammar rules like 136, don't attempt to match anything. They are
#     functions that change a variable. Rule 136 uses the (flip) function to
#     change a variable from one value to another.
#
#   * (if)
#     Check the rule indicated by the value. If it matches, call the (set)
#     function that must be provided.
#
#   * (set)
#     The value is a 2 element sequence. The first element is a variable and
#     the second is an expression. Set the variable to the value of the
#     evaluated expression.
#
#   * (ord)
#     Convert a character (1-9) to an integer.
#
#   * (match)
#     Return the string or character value of the last rule match.
#
#   * (len)
#     Return the length of a string value.
#
#   * (max)
#     The YAML spec grammar constrains some rules to complete in the next 1024
#     characters. The (max) function is used to indicate that this is the
#     case. How it is implemented (like many things) is left as an exercise for
#     the parser author.
#
#   * (exclude)
#     This one is a doozy. It indicates a rule that must not match during any
#     of the recursive sub-matches. Since it is used near the top of the
#     grammar, it affects almost everything.
#
#   * (+)
#     Return the first argument plus the second.
#
#   * (-)
#     Return the first argument minus the second.
#
#   * (<)
#     First argument is less than the second.
#
#   * (<=)
#     First argument is less than the second.

### 5.1. Character Set


#===============================================================================
# This is the complete set of characters allowed in a YAML stream.
#
# The (any) means that any one of the value group's rules must match for the
# group to match. The remaining rules are attempted in order.
#
# The rules beginning with `x` are hex codes. The pairs of hex codes are
# character ranges.

#
# The (***) function means the rule must match 0 or more times.
#
# The (<) function matches if the first argument is less than the second.
