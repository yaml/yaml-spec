      <title>Abstract</title>

      <para>
        <trademark>YAML</trademark> (rhymes with <quote>camel</quote>) is a
        human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization
        language designed around the common native data types of agile
        programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs
        ranging from configuration files to Internet messaging to object
        persistence to data auditing. Together with the <ulink
        url="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode standard for characters</ulink>,
        this specification provides all the information necessary to understand
        YAML Version 1.2 and to create programs that process YAML information.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      <quote>YAML Ain<q/>t Markup Language</quote> (abbreviated YAML) is a data
      serialization language designed to be human-friendly and work well with
      modern programming languages for common everyday tasks. This
      specification is both an introduction to the YAML language and the
      concepts supporting it, and also a complete specification of the
      information needed to develop <refterm
      primary="application">applications</refterm> for processing YAML.
    </para>

    <para>
      Open, interoperable and readily understandable tools have advanced
      computing immensely. YAML was designed from the start to be useful and
      friendly to people working with data. It uses Unicode <refterm
      primary="printable character">printable</refterm> characters, <refterm
      primary="indicator">some</refterm> of which provide structural
      information and the rest containing the data itself. YAML achieves a
      unique cleanness by minimizing the amount of structural characters and
      allowing the data to show itself in a natural and meaningful way. For
      example, <refterm primary="space"
      secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> may be used for structure,
      <refterm primary=": mapping value">colons</refterm> separate <refterm
      primary="key: value pair" >key:&nbsp;value pairs</refterm>, and <refterm
      primary="- block sequence entry">dashes</refterm> are used to create
      <quote>bullet</quote> <refterm primary="sequence">lists</refterm>.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are myriad flavors of <refterm primary="native data structure">data
      structures</refterm>, but they can all be adequately <refterm
      primary="represent">represented</refterm> with three basic primitives:
      <refterm primary="mapping">mappings</refterm> (hashes/dictionaries),
      <refterm primary="sequence">sequences</refterm> (arrays/lists) and
      <refterm primary="scalar">scalars</refterm> (strings/numbers). YAML
      leverages these primitives, and adds a simple typing system and <refterm
      primary="alias">aliasing</refterm> mechanism to form a complete language
      for <refterm primary="serialize">serializing</refterm> any <refterm
      primary="native data structure">native data structure</refterm>. While
      most programming languages can use YAML for data serialization, YAML
      excels in working with those languages that are fundamentally built
      around the three basic primitives. These include the new wave of agile
      languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Javascript.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are hundreds of different languages for programming, but only a
      handful of languages for storing and transferring data. Even though its
      potential is virtually boundless, YAML was specifically created to work
      well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files,
      interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence,
      and debugging of complex data structures. When data is easy to view and
      understand, programming becomes a simpler task.

    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Prior Art</title>

      <para>
        YAML<q/>s initial direction was set by the data serialization and
        markup language discussions among <ulink
        url="http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/">SML-DEV members</ulink>. Later
        on, it directly incorporated experience from Ingy d&ouml;t Net<q/>s
        Perl module <ulink
        url="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Denter/"
        >Data::Denter</ulink>. Since then, YAML has matured through ideas and
        support from its user community.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML integrates and builds upon concepts described by <ulink
        url="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/index.html">C</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://java.sun.com/">Java</ulink>, <ulink

        url="http://www.python.org/">Python</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt">RFC0822</ulink> (MAIL),
        <ulink
        url="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt">RFC1866</ulink>
        (HTML), <ulink
        url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC2045</ulink> (MIME),
        <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC2396</ulink> (URI),
        <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.html">XML</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://www.saxproject.org/">SAX</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP">SOAP</ulink>, and <ulink
        url="http://www.json.org/">JSON</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The syntax of YAML was motivated by Internet Mail (RFC0822) and remains
        partially compatible with that standard. Further, borrowing from MIME
        (RFC2045), YAML<q/>s top-level production is a <refterm
        primary="stream">stream</refterm> of independent <refterm
        primary="document">documents</refterm>, ideal for message-based
        distributed processing systems.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML<q/>s <refterm primary="space"
        secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm>-based scoping is similar
        to Python<q/>s (without the ambiguities caused by <refterm
        primary="tab">tabs</refterm>). <refterm primary="style"
        secondary="block">Indented blocks</refterm> facilitate easy inspection
        of the data<q/>s structure. YAML<q/>s <refterm primary="style"
        secondary="block" tertiary="literal">literal style</refterm> leverages
        this by enabling formatted text to be cleanly mixed within an <refterm
        primary="space" secondary="indentation">indented</refterm> structure
        without troublesome <refterm primary="escaping" secondary="in
        double-quoted scalars">escaping</refterm>. YAML also allows the use of
        traditional <refterm primary="indicator">indicator</refterm>-based
        scoping similar to JSON<q/>s and Perl<q/>s. Such <refterm
        primary="style" secondary="flow">flow content</refterm> can be freely
        nested inside <refterm primary="style" secondary="block">indented
        blocks</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML<q/>s <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
        tertiary="double-quoted">double-quoted style</refterm> uses familiar
        C-style <refterm primary="escaping" secondary="in double-quoted
        scalars">escape sequences</refterm>. This enables ASCII encoding of
        non-<refterm primary="printable character">printable</refterm> or 8-bit
        (ISO 8859-1) characters such as <link
        linkend="ns-esc-8-bit"><uquote>\x3B</uquote></link>. Non-<refterm
        primary="printable character">printable</refterm> 16-bit Unicode and
        32-bit (ISO/IEC 10646) characters are supported with <refterm
        primary="escaping" secondary="in double-quoted scalars">escape
        sequences</refterm> such as <link
        linkend="ns-esc-16-bit"><uquote>\u003B</uquote></link> and <link
        linkend="ns-esc-32-bit"><uquote>\U0000003B</uquote></link>.
      </para>

      <para>
        Motivated by HTML<q/>s end-of-line normalization, YAML<q/>s <refterm
        primary="line folding">line folding</refterm> employs an intuitive
        method of handling <refterm primary="line break">line breaks</refterm>.
        A single <refterm primary="line break">line break</refterm> is <refterm
        primary="line folding">folded</refterm> into a single <refterm
        primary="space">space</refterm>, while <refterm primary="empty
        line">empty lines</refterm> are interpreted as <refterm primary="line
        break">line break</refterm> characters. This technique allows for
        paragraphs to be word-wrapped without affecting the <refterm
        primary="scalar" secondary="canonical form">canonical form</refterm> of
        the <refterm primary="scalar">scalar content</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML<q/>s core type system is based on the requirements of agile
        languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. YAML directly supports both
        <refterm primary="collection">collections</refterm> (<refterm
        primary="mapping">mappings</refterm>, <refterm
        primary="sequence">sequences</refterm>) and <refterm
        primary="scalar">scalars</refterm>. Support for these common types
        enables programmers to use their language<q/>s <refterm primary="native
        data structure">native data structures</refterm> for YAML manipulation,
        instead of requiring a special document object model (DOM).
      </para>

      <para>
        Like XML<q/>s SOAP, YAML supports <refterm
        primary="serialize">serializing</refterm> a graph of <refterm
        primary="native data structure">native data structures</refterm>
        through an <refterm primary="alias">aliasing</refterm> mechanism. Also
        like SOAP, YAML provides for <refterm
        primary="application">application</refterm>-defined <refterm
        primary="tag">types</refterm>. This allows YAML to <refterm
        primary="represent">represent</refterm> rich data structures required
        for modern distributed computing. YAML provides globally unique
        <refterm primary="tag" secondary="global">type names</refterm> using a
        namespace mechanism inspired by Java<q/>s DNS-based package naming
        convention and XML<q/>s URI-based namespaces. In addition, YAML allows
        for private <refterm primary="tag" secondary="local">types</refterm>
        specific to a single <refterm
        primary="application">application</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML was designed to support incremental interfaces that include both
        input (<uquote>getNextEvent()</uquote>) and output
        (<uquote>sendNextEvent()</uquote>) one-pass interfaces. Together, these
        enable YAML to support the processing of large <refterm
        primary="document">documents</refterm> (e.g. transaction logs) or
        continuous <refterm primary="stream">streams</refterm> (e.g. feeds from
        a production machine).
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Relation to JSON</title>

      <para>
        Both JSON and YAML aim to be human readable data interchange formats.
        However, JSON and YAML have different priorities. JSON<q/>s foremost
        design goal is simplicity and universality. Thus, JSON is trivial to
        generate and parse, at the cost of reduced human readability. It also
        uses a lowest common denominator information model, ensuring any JSON
        data can be easily processed by every modern programming environment.
      </para>

      <para>
        In contrast, YAML<q/>s foremost design goals are human readability and
        support for <refterm primary="serialize">serializing</refterm>
        arbitrary <refterm primary="native data structure">native data
        structures</refterm>. Thus, YAML allows for extremely readable files,
        but is more complex to generate and parse. In addition, YAML ventures
        beyond the lowest common denominator data types, requiring more complex
        processing when crossing between different programming environments.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML can therefore be viewed as a natural superset of JSON, offering
        improved human readability and a more complete information model. This
        is also the case in practice; every JSON file is also a valid YAML
        file. This makes it easy to migrate from JSON to YAML if/when the
        additional features are required.
      </para>

      <para>
        It may be useful to define a intermediate format between YAML and JSON.
        Such a format would be trivial to parse (but not very human readable),
        like JSON. At the same time, it would allow for <refterm
        primary="serialize">serializing</refterm> arbitrary <refterm
        primary="native data structure">native data structures</refterm>, like
        YAML. Such a format might also serve as YAML<q/>s "canonical format".
        Defining such a <quote>YSON</quote> format (YSON is a Serialized Object
        Notation) can be done either by enhancing the JSON specification or by
        restricting the YAML specification. Such a definition is beyond the
        scope of this specification.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <pagebreak/>

    <sect1>
      <title>Relation to XML</title>

      <para>
        Newcomers to YAML often search for its correlation to the eXtensible
        Markup Language (XML). Although the two languages may actually compete
        in several application domains, there is no direct correlation between
        them.
      </para>

      <para>
        YAML is primarily a data serialization language. XML was designed to be
        backwards compatible with the Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML), which was designed to support structured documentation. XML
        therefore had many design constraints placed on it that YAML does not
        share. XML is a pioneer in many domains, YAML is the result of lessons
        learned from XML and other technologies.
      </para>

      <para>
        It should be mentioned that there are ongoing efforts to define
        standard XML/YAML mappings. This generally requires that a subset of
        each language be used. For more information on using both XML and YAML,
        please visit <ulink url="http://yaml.org/xml"/>.

      <title>Terminology</title>

      <para>
        This specification uses key words based on <ulink
        url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</ulink> to indicate
        requirement level. In particular, the following words are used to
        describe the actions of a YAML <refterm
        primary="processor">processor</refterm>:

          <listitem>
            The word <emphasis>may</emphasis>, or the adjective
            <emphasis>optional</emphasis>, mean that conforming YAML <refterm

          <listitem>
            The word <emphasis>should</emphasis>, or the adjective
            <emphasis>recommended</emphasis>, mean that there could be reasons
            for a YAML <refterm primary="processor">processor</refterm> to
            deviate from the behavior described, but that such deviation could
            hurt interoperability and should therefore be advertised with
            appropriate notice.
          </listitem>

    <title>Processing YAML Information</title>

    <para>
      YAML is both a text format and a method for <refterm
      primary="present">presenting</refterm> any <refterm primary="native data
      structure">native data structure</refterm> in this format. Therefore,
      this specification defines two concepts: a class of data objects called
      YAML <refterm primary="representation">representations</refterm>, and a
      syntax for <refterm primary="present">presenting</refterm> YAML <refterm
      primary="representation">representations</refterm> as a series of
      characters, called a YAML <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm>. A
      YAML <defterm primary="processor">processor</defterm> is a tool for
      converting information between these complementary views. It is assumed
      that a YAML processor does its work on behalf of another module, called
      an <defterm primary="application">application</defterm>. This chapter
      describes the information structures a YAML processor must provide to or
      obtain from the application.
    </para>

    <para>
      YAML information is used in two ways: for machine processing, and for
      human consumption. The challenge of reconciling these two perspectives is
      best done in three distinct translation stages: <refterm
      primary="representation">representation</refterm>, <refterm
      primary="serialization">serialization</refterm>, and <refterm
      primary="presentation">presentation</refterm>. <refterm
      primary="representation">Representation</refterm> addresses how YAML
      views <refterm primary="native data structure">native data
      structures</refterm> to achieve portability between programming
      environments. <refterm primary="serialization">Serialization</refterm>
      concerns itself with turning a YAML <refterm
      primary="representation">representation</refterm> into a serial form,
      that is, a form with sequential access constraints. <refterm
      primary="presentation">Presentation</refterm> deals with the formatting
      of a YAML <refterm primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> as a
      series of characters in a human-friendly manner.

        Translating between <refterm primary="native data structure">native
        data structures</refterm> and a character <refterm
        primary="stream">stream</refterm> is done in several logically distinct
        stages, each with a well defined input and output data model, as shown
        in the following diagram:

      <para>
        A YAML processor need not expose the <refterm
        primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> or <refterm
        primary="representation">representation</refterm> stages. It may
        translate directly between <refterm primary="native data
        structure">native data structures</refterm> and a character <refterm
        primary="stream">stream</refterm> (<refterm
        primary="dump">dump</refterm> and <refterm
        primary="load">load</refterm> in the diagram above). However, such a
        direct translation should take place so that the <refterm
        primary="native data structure">native data structures</refterm> are
        <refterm primary="construct">constructed</refterm> only from
        information available in the <refterm
        primary="representation">representation</refterm>. In particular,
        <refterm primary="key" secondary="order">mapping key order</refterm>,
        <refterm primary="comment">comments</refterm>, and <refterm
        primary="tag" secondary="handle">tag handles</refterm> should not be
        refernced during <refterm primary="compose">composition</refterm>.

              <para>
                YAML <defterm primary="represent">represents</defterm> any
                <defterm primary="native data structure">native data
                structure</defterm> using three <refterm primary="kind">node
                kinds</refterm>: <refterm primary="sequence">sequence</refterm>
                - an ordered series of entries; <refterm
                primary="mapping">mapping</refterm> - an unordered association
                of <refterm primary="equality">unique</refterm> <refterm
                primary="key">keys</refterm> to <refterm
                primary="value">values</refterm>; and <refterm
                primary="scalar">scalar</refterm> - any datum with opaque
                structure presentable as a series of Unicode characters.
                Combined, these primitives generate directed graph structures.
                These primitives were chosen because they are both powerful and
                familiar: the <refterm primary="sequence">sequence</refterm>
                corresponds to a Perl array and a Python list, the <refterm
                primary="mapping">mapping</refterm> corresponds to a Perl hash
                table and a Python dictionary. The <refterm
                primary="scalar">scalar</refterm> represents strings, integers,
                dates, and other atomic data types.
              </para>

              <para>
                Each YAML <refterm primary="node">node</refterm> requires, in
                addition to its <refterm primary="kind">kind</refterm> and
                <refterm primary="content">content</refterm>, a <refterm
                primary="tag">tag</refterm> specifying its data type. Type
                specifiers are either <refterm primary="tag"
                secondary="global">global</refterm> URIs, or are <refterm
                primary="tag" secondary="local">local</refterm> in scope to a
                single <refterm primary="application">application</refterm>.
                For example, an integer is represented in YAML with a <refterm
                primary="scalar">scalar</refterm> plus the <refterm
                primary="tag" secondary="global">global tag</refterm>
                <uquote>tag:yaml.org,2002:int</uquote>. Similarly, an invoice
                object, particular to a given organization, could be
                represented as a <refterm primary="mapping">mapping</refterm>
                together with the <refterm primary="tag"
                secondary="local">local tag</refterm>
                <uquote>!invoice</uquote>. This simple model can represent any
                data structure independent of programming language.

              For sequential access mediums, such as an event callback API, a
              YAML <refterm primary="representation">representation</refterm>
              must be <defterm primary="serialize">serialized</defterm> to an
              ordered tree. Since in a YAML <refterm
              primary="representation">representation</refterm>, <refterm
              primary="key">mapping keys</refterm> are unordered and <refterm
              primary="node">nodes</refterm> may be referenced more than once
              (have more than one incoming <quote>arrow</quote>), the
              serialization process is required to impose an <refterm
              primary="key" secondary="order">ordering</refterm> on the
              <refterm primary="key">mapping keys</refterm> and to replace the
              second and subsequent references to a given <refterm
              primary="node">node</refterm> with place holders called <refterm
              primary="alias">aliases</refterm>. YAML does not specify how
              these <defterm primary="serialization"
              secondary="detail">serialization details</defterm> are chosen. It
              is up to the YAML <refterm

              names, possibly with the help of the <refterm

              process, a YAML <refterm primary="serialization">serialization
              tree</refterm>, can then be traversed to produce a series of

              stylistic options which go far beyond the minimal functional
              needs of simple data storage. Therefore the YAML <refterm

        This section specifies the formal details of the results of the above
        processes. To maximize data portability between programming languages
        and implementations, users of YAML should be mindful of the distinction
        between <refterm primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> or
        <refterm primary="presentation">presentation</refterm> properties and
        those which are part of the YAML <refterm
        primary="representation">representation</refterm>. Thus, while imposing
        a <refterm primary="key" secondary="order">order</refterm> on <refterm
        primary="key">mapping keys</refterm> is necessary for flattening YAML
        <refterm primary="representation">representations</refterm> to a
        sequential access medium, this <refterm primary="serialization"
        secondary="detail">serialization detail</refterm> must not be used to
        convey <refterm primary="application">application</refterm> level
        information. In a similar manner, while <refterm primary="space"
        secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> technique and a choice of
        a <refterm primary="style">node style</refterm> are needed for the
        human readability, these <refterm primary="presentation"
        secondary="detail">presentation details</refterm> are neither part of
        the YAML <refterm primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> nor

        carefully separating properties needed for <refterm
        primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> and <refterm

            primary="collection">collections</defterm>. In this view, sequences
            are treated as mappings with integer keys starting at zero. Having
            a unified collections view for sequences and mappings is helpful
            both for theoretical analysis and for creating practical YAML tools
            and APIs. This strategy is also used by the Javascript programming
            language.

            secondary="global">Global tags</defterm> are <ulink

            globally unique across all <refterm
            primary="application">applications</refterm>. The
            <uquote>tag:</uquote> <ulink
            url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4151.html">URI scheme</ulink> is
            recommended for all global YAML tags. In contrast, <defterm
            primary="tag" secondary="local">local tags</defterm> are specific
            to a single <refterm primary="application">application</refterm>.
            Local tags start with <defterm primary="! tag indicator"
            secondary="! local tag"><uquote>!</uquote></defterm>, are not URIs
            and are not expected to be globally unique. YAML provides a
            <refterm primary="directive" secondary="TAG"><uquote>TAG</uquote>
            directive</refterm> to make tag notation less verbose; it also
            offers easy migration from local to global tags. To ensure this,
            local tags are restricted to the URI character set and use URI
            character <refterm primary="% escaping in URI">escaping</refterm>.
          </para>

          <para>
            YAML does not mandate any special relationship between different
            tags that begin with the same substring. Tags ending with URI
            fragments (containing <uquote>#</uquote>) are no exception; tags
            that share the same base URI but differ in their fragment part are
            considered to be different, independent tags. By convention,
            fragments are used to identify different <quote>variants</quote> of
            a tag, while <uquote>/</uquote> is used to define nested tag
            <quote>namespace</quote> hierarchies. However, this is merely a
            convention, and each tag may employ its own rules. For example,
            Perl tags may use <uquote>::</uquote> to express namespace
            hierarchies, Java tags may use <uquote>.</uquote>, etc.
          </para>

          <para>
            YAML tags are used to associate meta information with each <refterm
            primary="node">node</refterm>. In particular, each tag must specify
            the expected <refterm primary="kind">node kind</refterm> (<refterm
            primary="scalar">scalar</refterm>, <refterm

            primary="scalar">Scalar</refterm> tags must also provide a
            mechanism for converting <refterm primary="scalar"
            secondary="content format">formatted content</refterm> to a
            <refterm primary="scalar" secondary="canonical form">canonical
            form</refterm> for supporting <refterm
            primary="equality">equality</refterm> testing. Furthermore, a tag
            may provide additional information such as the set of allowed
            <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> values for validation,
            a mechanism for <refterm primary="tag" secondary="resolution">tag

            anchor. Otherwise, anchor names are a <refterm
            primary="serialization" secondary="detail">serialization
            detail</refterm> and are discarded once <refterm
            primary="compose">composing</refterm> is completed. When <refterm

            primary="serialization">serialization</refterm> having the
            specified anchor. Therefore, anchors need not be unique within a
            <refterm primary="serialization">serialization</refterm>. In
            addition, an anchor need not have an alias node referring to it. It
            is therefore possible to provide an anchor for all <refterm

          Resolving the <refterm primary="tag">tag</refterm> of a <refterm

          <refterm primary="alias">aliases</refterm>), tag resolution must
          depend only on the path to the first (<refterm

          primary="node">node</refterm>.
        </para>

        <para>
          Note that resolution must not consider <refterm
          primary="presentation" secondary="detail">presentation

          primary="comment">comments</refterm>, <refterm primary="space"
          secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> and <refterm
          primary="style">node style</refterm>. Also, resolution must not
          consider the <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> of any
          other <refterm primary="node">node</refterm>, except for the <refterm
          primary="content">content</refterm> of the <refterm primary="key">key
          nodes</refterm> directly along the path leading from the <refterm
          primary="node" secondary="root">root</refterm> to the resolved
          <refterm primary="node" >node</refterm>. Finally, resolution must not
          consider the <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> of a
          sibling <refterm primary="node">node</refterm> in a <refterm
          primary="collection">collection</refterm>, or the <refterm

        </para>

        <para>
          These rules ensure that tag resolution can be performed as soon as a
          <refterm primary="node">node</refterm> is first encountered in the
          <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm>, typically before its
          <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> is <refterm
          primary="parse">parsed</refterm>. Also, tag resolution only requires
          referring to a relatively small number of previously parsed <refterm
          primary="node">nodes</refterm>. Thus, in most cases, tag resolution
          in one-pass <refterm primary="processor">processors</refterm> is both
          possible and practical.

  <chapter id="Syntax">
    <title>Syntax Conventions</title>

    <para>
      The following chapters formally define the syntax of YAML character
      <refterm primary="stream">streams</refterm>, using parameterized BNF
      productions. Each BNF production is both named and numbered for easy
      reference. Whenever possible, basic structures are specified before the
      more complex structures using them in a <quote>bottom up</quote> fashion.
    </para>

    <para>
      The order of alternatives inside a production is significant. Subsequent
      alternatives are only considered when previous ones fails. See for
      example the <nonterminal
      def="#b-break"><userinput>b-break</userinput></nonterminal> production.
      In addition, production matching is expected to be greedy. Optional
      (<userinput>?</userinput>), zero-or-more (<userinput>*</userinput>) and
      one-or-more (<userinput>+</userinput>) patterns are always expected to
      match as much of the input as possible.
    </para>

    <para>
      The productions are accompanied by examples, which are given side-by-side
      next to equivalent YAML text in an explanatory format. This format uses
      only <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow" tertiary="collection">flow
      collections</refterm>, <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
      tertiary="double-quoted">double-quoted scalars</refterm>, and explicit
      <refterm primary="tag">tags</refterm> for each <refterm
      primary="node">node</refterm>.
    </para>

    <para>
      A reference implementation using the productions is available as the
      <ulink
      url="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/YamlReference"
      >YamlReference</ulink> Haskell package. This reference implementation is
      also available as an interactive web application at <ulink

      <title>Production Parameters</title>

      <para>
        YAML<q/>s syntax is designed for maximal human readability. This
        requires <refterm primary="parse">parsing</refterm> to depend on the
        surrounding text. For notational compactness, this dependency is
        expressed using parameterized BNF productions.
      </para>

      <para>
        This sensitivity is the cause of most of the complexity of the YAML
        syntax definition. It is further complicated by struggling with the
        human tendency to look ahead when interpreting text. These
        complications are of course the source of most of YAML<q/>s power to
        <refterm primary="presentation">present</refterm> data in a very human
        readable way.
      </para>

      <para>
        Productions use any of the following parameters:
      </para>

      <variablelist termlength="15">
        <varlistentry>
          <term>
            Indentation: <varname>n</varname> or <varname>m</varname>
          </term>

          <listitem>
            Many productions use an explicit <refterm primary="space"
            secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> level parameter. This
            is less elegant than Python<q/>s <quote>indent</quote> and
            <quote>undent</quote> conceptual tokens. However it is required to
            formally express YAML<q/>s indentation rules.

      <variablelist termlength="15">

          <listitem>
            <para>
              This parameter allows productions to tweak their behavior
              according to their surrounding. YAML supports two groups of
              <defterm primary="context">contexts</defterm>, distinguishing
              between <refterm primary="style" secondary="block">block
              styles</refterm> and <refterm primary="style"
              secondary="flow">flow styles</refterm>.
            </para>

            <para>
              In <refterm primary="style" secondary="block">block
              styles</refterm>, <refterm primary="space"
              secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> is used to
              delineate structure. To capture human perception of <refterm
              primary="space" secondary="indentation">indentation</refterm> the
              rules require special treatment of the <refterm primary="- block
              sequence entry"><uquote>-</uquote></refterm> character, used in
              <refterm primary="style" secondary="block"
              tertiary="sequence">block sequences</refterm>. Hence in some
              cases productions need to behave differently inside <refterm
              primary="style" secondary="block" tertiary="sequence">block
              sequences</refterm> (<defterm primary="context"
              secondary="block-in">block-in context</defterm>) and outside them
              (<defterm primary="context" secondary="block-out">block-out
              context</defterm>).
            </para>

            <para>
              In <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow">flow
              styles</refterm>, explicit <refterm
              primary="indicator">indicators</refterm> are used to delineate
              structure. These styles can be viewed as the natural extension of
              JSON to cover <refterm primary="tag">tagged</refterm>, <refterm
              primary="style" secondary="flow"

              primary="style" secondary="flow" tertiary="plain">plain
              scalars</refterm>. Since the latter have no delineating <refterm
              primary="indicator">indicators</refterm>, they are subject to
              some restrictions to avoid ambiguities. These restrictions depend
              on where they appear: as implicit keys directly inside a <refterm
              primary="style" secondary="block" tertiary="mapping">block
              mapping</refterm> (<defterm primary="context"

              tertiary="mapping">flow mapping</refterm> (<defterm
              primary="context" secondary="flow-key">flow-key</defterm>); as
              values inside a <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
              tertiary="collection">flow collection</refterm> (<defterm

      <title>Character Encodings</title>

      <para>
        All characters mentioned in this specification are Unicode code points.
        Each such code point is written as one or more bytes depending on the
        <defterm primary="character encoding">character encoding</defterm>
        used. Note that in UTF-16, characters above
        <userinput>#xFFFF</userinput> are written as four bytes, using a
        surrogate pair.
      </para>

      <para>
        The character encoding is a <refterm primary="presentation"
        secondary="detail">presentation detail</refterm> and must not be used
        to convey <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> information.
      </para>

      <para>
        On input, a YAML <refterm primary="processor">processor</refterm> must
        support the UTF-8 and UTF-16 character encodings. For <refterm
        primary="JSON compatibility">JSON compatibility</refterm>, the UTF-32
        encodings must also be supported.
      </para>

      <para>
        If a character <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm> begins with a
        <defterm primary="byte order mark">byte order mark</defterm>, the
        character encoding will be taken to be as as indicated by the byte
        order mark. Otherwise, the <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm>
        must begin with an ASCII character. This allows the encoding to be
        deduced by the pattern of null (<userinput>#x00</userinput>)
        characters.
      </para>

      <para>
        To make it easier to concatenate <refterm
        primary="stream">streams</refterm>, byte order marks may appear at the
        start of any <refterm primary="document">document</refterm>. However
        all <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm> in the same
        <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm> must use the same character
        encoding.
      </para>
        
      <para>
        To allow for <refterm primary="JSON compatibility">JSON
        compatibility</refterm>, byte order marks are also allowed inside
        <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
        tertiary="double-quoted">quoted scalars</refterm>. For readability,
        such <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> byte order marks
        should be <refterm primary="escaping" secondary="in double-quoted
        scalars">escaped</refterm> on output.
      </para>

      <pagebreak/>

      <para>
        The encoding can therefore be deduced by matching the first few bytes
        of the <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm> with the following
        table rows (in order):

        The recommended output encoding is UTF-8. If another encoding is used,
        it is recommended that an explicit byte order mark be used, even if the
        first <refterm primary="stream">stream</refterm> character is ASCII.

      <para>
        In YAML <refterm primary="style" secondary="block">block
        styles</refterm>, structure is determined by <defterm primary="space"
        secondary="indentation">indentation</defterm>. In general, indentation
        is defined as a zero or more <refterm primary="space">space</refterm>
        characters at the start of a line.
      </para>

      <para>
        To maintain portability, <refterm primary="tab">tab</refterm>
        characters must not be used in indentation, since different systems
        treat <refterm primary="tab">tabs</refterm> differently. Note that most
        modern editors may be configured so that pressing the <refterm
        primary="tab">tab</refterm> key results in the insertion of an
        appropriate number of <refterm primary="space">spaces</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The amount of indentation is a <refterm primary="presentation"
        secondary="detail">presentation detail</refterm> and must not be used

        A <refterm primary="style" secondary="block">block style</refterm>
        construct is terminated when encountering a line which is less indented

        <para>

          The <defterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
          tertiary="plain">plain</defterm> (unquoted) style has no identifying
          <refterm primary="indicator">indicators</refterm> and provides no
          form of escaping. It is therefore the most readable, most limited and
          most <refterm primary="context">context</refterm> sensitive <refterm
          primary="style">style</refterm>. In addition to a restricted
          character set, a plain scalar must not be empty, or contain leading
          or trailing <refterm primary="space" secondary="white">white
          space</refterm> characters. It is only possible to break a long plain
          line where a <refterm primary="space">space</refterm> character is
          surrounded by non-<refterm primary="space"
          secondary="white">spaces</refterm>.
        </para>

        <para>
          Plain scalars must not begin with most <refterm

          ambiguity with other YAML constructs. However, the <refterm

          primary="? mapping key"><uquote>?</uquote></refterm> and <refterm

          <refterm primary="indicator">indicators</refterm> may be used as the
          first character if followed by a non-<refterm primary="space"
          secondary="white">space</refterm> character, as this causes no
          ambiguity.

          Normally, YAML insists the <defterm primary=": mapping

          <refterm primary="space" secondary="separation">separated</refterm>

          primary="space" secondary="white">white space</refterm>. A benefit of
          this restriction is that the <uquote>:</uquote> character can be used
          inside <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow"
          tertiary="plain">plain scalars</refterm>, as long as it is not
          followed by <refterm primary="space" secondary="white">white
          space</refterm>. This allows for unquoted URLs and timestamps. It is
          also a potential source for confusion as <uquote>a:1</uquote> is a
          <refterm primary="style" secondary="flow" tertiary="plain">plain

          If the <uquote>?</uquote> indicator is omitted, <refterm
          primary="parse">parsing</refterm> needs to see past the <defterm
          primary="key" secondary="implicit">implicit key</defterm> to
          recognize it as such. To limit the amount of lookahead required, the
          <uquote>:</uquote> indicator must appear at most 1024 Unicode
          characters beyond the start of the <refterm
          primary="key">key</refterm>. In addition, the <refterm
          primary="key">key</refterm> is restricted to a single line.
        </para>

        <para>
          Note that YAML allows arbitrary <refterm
          primary="node">nodes</refterm> to be used as <refterm
          primary="key">keys</refterm>. In particular, a <refterm
          primary="key">key</refterm> may be a <refterm
          primary="sequence">sequence</refterm> or a <refterm
          primary="mapping">mapping</refterm>. Thus, without the above
          restrictions, practical one-pass <refterm
          primary="parse">parsing</refterm> would have been impossible to
          implement.

        <para>
          A document may be preceded by a <defterm primpary="document"

          optional <refterm primary="comment">comment</refterm> lines. Note
          that all <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm> in a stream
          must use the same <refterm primary="character encoding">character
          encoding</refterm>. However it is valid to re-specify the <refterm

          easier to concatenate streams.

        <title>Document Markers</title>

        <para>
          Using <refterm primary="directive">directives</refterm> raises a
          potential ambiguity. It is valid to have a <refterm primary="%
          directive"><uquote>%</uquote></refterm> character at the start of a
          line (e.g. as the first character of a top-level <refterm
          primary="mapping">mapping</refterm> <refterm
          primary="key">key</refterm>). How, then, to distinguish between an
          actual <refterm primary="directive">directive</refterm> and a
          <refterm primary="content">content</refterm> line that happens to
          start with a <refterm primary="%
          directive"><uquote>%</uquote></refterm> character?
        </para>

        <para>
          The solution is the use of two special <defterm
          primary="marker">marker</defterm> lines to control the processing of
          <refterm primary="directive">directives</refterm>, one at the start
          of a <refterm primary="document">document</refterm> and one at the
          end.
        </para>

        <para>
          At the start of a <refterm primary="document">document</refterm>,
          lines beginning with a <refterm primary="%
          directive"><uquote>%</uquote></refterm> character are assumed to be
          <refterm primary="directive">directives</refterm>. The (possibly
          empty) list of <refterm primary="directive">directives</refterm> is
          terminated by a <defterm primary="marker" secondary="directives
          end">directives end marker</defterm> line. Lines following this
          marker can safely use <refterm primary="%
          directive"><uquote>%</uquote></refterm> as the first character.
        </para>

        <para>
          At the end of a <refterm primary="document">document</refterm>, a
          <defterm primary="marker" secondary="document end">document end
          marker</defterm> line is used to signal the <refterm
          primary="parse">parser</refterm> to begin scanning for <refterm
          primary="directive">directives</refterm> again.
        </para>

        <para>
          The existence of this optional <defterm primary="document"
          secondary="suffix">document suffix</defterm> does not necessarily
          indicate the existence of an actual following <refterm
          primary="document">document</refterm>.
        </para>

        <para>
          Obviously, the actual <refterm primary="content">content</refterm>
          lines are therefore forbidden to begin with either of these markers.

        A YAML <defterm primary="stream">stream</defterm> consists of zero or
        more <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm>. Subsequent
        <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm> require some sort of
        separation <refterm primary="marker">marker</refterm> line. If a
        <refterm primary="document">document</refterm> is not terminated by a
        <refterm primary="marker" secondary="document end">document end
        marker</refterm> line, then the following <refterm

            Allowing multiple <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm>
            in a single stream makes YAML suitable for log files and similar
            <refterm primary="application">applications</refterm>. Note that
            each <refterm primary="document">document</refterm> is independent

              Concatenating two YAML streams requires both to use the same
              <refterm primary="character encoding">character
              encoding</refterm>. In addition, it is necessary to separate
              between the last <refterm primary="document">document</refterm>
              of the first stream and the first <refterm
              primary="document">document</refterm> of the second stream.
              This is easily ensured by inserting an <refterm
              primary="marker" secondary="document end">document end
              marker</refterm> between the two streams. Note this is safe
              regardless of the content of either stream. In particular,
              either or both may be empty, and the first stream may or may not
              already contain such a marker.

              The <refterm primary="marker" secondary="document end">document

              or starting the next <refterm

              to complete processing a <refterm

              the next one to arrive. The sender may also transmit "keep-alive"

      <title>Other Schemas</title>

      <para>
        None of the above recommended <refterm
        primary="schema">schemas</refterm> preclude the use of arbitrary
        explicit <refterm primary="tag">tags</refterm>. Hence YAML <refterm
        primary="processor">processors</refterm> for a particular programming
        language typically provide some form of <refterm primary="tag"
        secondary="local">local tags</refterm> that map directly to the
        language<q/>s <refterm primary="native data structure">native data
        structures</refterm> (e.g., <userinput>!ruby/object:Set</userinput>).
      </para>

      <para>
        While such <refterm primary="tag" secondary="local">local
        tags</refterm> are useful for ad-hoc <refterm
        primary="application">applications</refterm>, they do not suffice for
        stable, interoperable cross-<refterm
        primary="application">application</refterm> or cross-platform data
        exchange.
      </para>

      <para>
        Interoperable <refterm primary="schema">schemas</refterm> make use of
        <refterm primary="tag" secondary="global">global tags</refterm> (URIs)
        that <refterm primary="represent">represent</refterm> the same data
        across different programming languages. In addition, an interoperable
        <refterm primary="schema">schema</refterm> may provide additional
        <refterm primary="tag" secondary="resolution">tag resolution</refterm>
        rules. Such rules may provide additional regular expressions, as well
        as consider the path to the <refterm primary="node">node</refterm>.
        This allows interoperable <refterm primary="schema">schemas</refterm>
        to use <refterm primary="tag"
        secondary="non-specific">untagged</refterm> <refterm
        primary="node">nodes</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        It is strongly recommended that such <refterm
        primary="schema">schemas</refterm> be based on the <refterm
        primary="schema" secondary="core">core schema</refterm> defined above.
        In addition, it is strongly recommended that such <refterm
        primary="schema">schemas</refterm> make as much use as possible of the
        the <defterm primary="tag" secondary="repository">YAML tag
        repository</defterm> at <ulink url="http://yaml.org/type/"/>. This
        repository provides recommended <refterm primary="tag"
        secondary="global">global tags</refterm> for increasing the portability
        of YAML <refterm primary="document">documents</refterm> between
        different <refterm primary="application">applications</refterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The tag repository is intentionally left out of the scope of this
        specification. This allows it to evolve to better support YAML <refterm
        primary="application">applications</refterm>. Hence, developers are
        encouraged to submit new <quote>universal</quote> types to the
        repository. The yaml-core mailing list at <ulink
        url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/yaml-core"/> is the
        preferred method for such submissions, as well as raising any questions
        regarding this draft.
