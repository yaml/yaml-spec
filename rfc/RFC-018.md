RFC-018
=======

Allow multiple anchors on a node.

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: anchors

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

The spec allows for a single anchor to be placed on a node.

```
--- &a
b
```

While this is fine for regular use, when a compositional YAML DOM is
created multiple anchors may end up being set on a single node.

For example assume a method to *merge* the following two documents
preserving the anchors and their references.

```
# X
--- 
a: &aa
  b: c
d: *aa
```

```
# Y
---
a: &ii
  e: f
g: *ii
```

```
# X + Y (loss of information)
---
a: &aa
  b: c
  e: f
d: *aa
g: *aa
```

With single anchor semantics the merge is impossible while preserving both anchors.
At best only a single anchor maybe be preserved. Any subsequent merges with a reference
to the erased anchor are going to fail.

```
# Z
h: *ii
```

## Proposal

We propose to relax this requirement so that multiple anchors may
be placed on a node.

```
--- &a &b
b
```

In this case anchors are preserved across merges so no loss of information
is observed.

## Examples

```
# X + Y (no loss of information)
---
a: &aa &ii
  b: c
  e: f
d: *aa
g: *ii
```

```
# X + Y + Z (no loss of information)
---
a: &aa &ii
  b: c
  e: f
d: *aa
g: *ii
h: *ii
```

## Explanation

Multiple anchors allow preservation of anchors across multiple merge operations.
